2	"I moved to this area last year and decided to check funny looking (Giant Pink Hog) shop out!  We are sold!!  I get my bacon and sausage here and my family loves it!!  It is definitely a treat when we need pork products to get them here! They are usually busy crazy, but it's kinda fun and exciting for this area to have a local shop doing so well!"
2	"Try the green chilli burrito, jalepeno and cheese snack sticks and any sausage...You won't be disappointed!! \n\nBusy on the weekends so be patient and don't feel overwhelmed. Its a small place with lots of people so don't feel bad and take your time!\n\nThey give you free samples of their snack sticks too!\n\nPrices are a little on the higher side but the quality is worth it!!!"
2	"Okay I have not actually BEEN to this farm, but I just tasted some of their peach pie from the peach festival this last weekend...\n\nMy friend at work made the trek to queen creek for the festival, and although she said the festival wasn't all that amazing, the pie I just ate is to die for.\n\nThe best peach pie I have ever tasted. I'd give it 5 stars, but since I personally have never been to this location, it wouldn't be accurate. The 3 bites of pie I had made it worth a review though :)"
2	"I have lived right by this place for 6 months and never visited, so I checked it out for dinner. The farm part was closed in the evening, but the restaurant was open. Now, I have family in rural Ohio, so I know country life and what eating in the barn is all about and although this was enclosed, it was like a barn. I ordered the fried chicken and my friend the meatloaf. Both came with a scoop of mashed potatoes, a scoop of sweet potatoes and some zucchini. When I first saw the chicken I was like \""one piece?!\"" (remember, I am fat)... As it turned out, it was boneless chicken and pretty darn good. I sampled the meatloaf and while it wasn't the best I have had, it was good. The coke I think was straight from the can. I ordered pie for dessert - my friend had peacan and I went for the apple, walnet, caramel. We asked to make it a la mode. It came out with a slice of pie and some soft-serve ice cream, but actually it was very good. \n\nAnother good aspect of the farm (although it didn't quite fit in with the barn atmosphere) was the live jazz singer and wine tasting going on just on the other side of the half wall. We could hear it, but didn't get over for the event. This weekend was the first in that series, so if you are up for some wine and light jazz, give it a shot. This was straight farm-to-table dinning and a nice atmosphere."
2	"Been here for two years in a row. Total of three times. This year the peach crop where they had opened up the farm was very limited. The peaches were small and went bad the very next day. Then why the four stars? Its the experience people. We went a week after the peach festival. Last year we did the same but the peach crop was humongous and the peaches were awesome. \n\nPicking fruit off the tree and stacking it in your little box they give you is such a cool experience. Visitors from out of town go wild with excitement when picking peaches and smiles are endless. \n\nGreat picture taking opportunities with your kids. The drive there has become a lot better as most of the construction is over with. The directions are pretty straight forward. \n\nA few things good to know:\n\nDuring the peach festival, there is a hayride that takes you to the peach trees and back. Its included in your entrance fee. Cannot remember what the entrance fee was. The peach festival is a good thing to do if the temperatures are going to be less than 97 degrees that day because the there is a lot of waiting in the sun etc when the hayride is involved. They do provide you with water coolers at their peach stations so you are covered in that department. Lots of dust out on the farm and during the hayride so not good for people with breathing problems. \n\nIf you do not go during the peach festival, the cool thing is, you can drive your car straight to the trees, the peach and apricot trees that is and start picking without walking too long of a distance. \n\nThe peach picking season is pretty short. Good to go during the earlier part of the picking season otherwise you will get sub par crops. Visitors, Do NOT carry the peaches back in your luggage through the airport as they will be crushed and made to pulp. Carry them in the box they give you and with lots of padding."
2	"The farm is awesome but if we are rating the food I would have given one star. I forget what they call their cafe but it really is not that great. \n\nThe farm itself is fun though.  There is always something going on.  Fall time it is the best - our kids have a blast on all the little rides, and the food they cook from the farm (pulled pork) not the cafe is really good.\n\nIt is a little pricey but I suppose they got to off set costs."
2	"So much going on at this farm, and its really great to visit, and pick your own fruit when its in season! Great for all ages.  Its right across the street from the Queen Creek Olive Mill, so its great to tour both in one day, get a feel for quality local businesses."
1	"Honestly, I come here when I'm en route to QC Olive Mill. I come to pick up some unique local gifts for out of town friends/family, but each time I come I'm a little disappointed in their lack of friendliness or helpfulness. I'm never greeted when I come into the store (even though it's always dead), and when I ask questions about the different products I get a half-assed answer. \n\nI still stop by each time I go to QCOM to get a couple of local preserves or salsas for my gift baskets, but I'm certainly not coming with the hopes of being greeted with a smile, and I don't bother asking questions anymore..."
1	"Don't waste your time or money\n\nWe went to Schnepf Farms today and paid $5 per person (instead of $2) so we could ride all of the rides.  Only problem.... not one single ride was open.  People were just wandering around looking for something do.  Total waste of time and money."
1	"What a disappointment this place has become.  I think they have forgotten their local roots and become way to commercialized.  I visited most recently and was severely disappointed.  Not only in the overall condition of the grounds but the fact that it is clear their sole motivation is to make a $. \n\nThey have a country store and it is very misleading, you think the majority of the good sold would be local, however this is not the case. If you look closely most of it is packaged or produced outside of Arizona or Queen Creek and then they put their own label on it.  I would expect more from a \""local\"" farming family.  \n\nI think the concept of the family farm is good and I commend them for their long heritage in the area. I just think they have lost sight of the bigger picture and the values that one time made them so successful.  Big is not always better. I think they would be better off concentrating on a select few events or amenities, rather than try and have so much and with so little quality."
1	"This place is FAR away! We came here to pick our own produce. The place was swarming with weeds! They said that it was because of the recent rains, but come on!\n\nWe did get some great beets, and we walked around the large farm. It was quite dead while we were there (a Thursday in March), but we know there can be a lot going on here during festivals, etc. The animals were fun to look at, but I think some of them needed grooming. They were way too hot being outside!\n\nAll in all, we would not come back here again except to maybe try out the festivals (Peach Festival maybe)."
1	"My family and I went today for the Pumpkin and Chili festival.  The place was dead and half of the stands weren't open.  No biggie - but other than a couple of areas with pumpkins you would have never even realized anything special was going on.  On the website it made things sound a lot more fun and I didn't see once a reference that they don't accept debit or credit cards anywhere. No ATM in sight either - I knoe I saw more than one family trying to find one\n\nI also think they really need to consider cleaning up the place and putting a little money back into it.  It really looked very shabby.  I am from the midwest and grew up on a farm and our family farm looked better.  \n\nall-in-all a poor representation of a family farm outing and I don't think we will ever be back again."
1	"We went this summer for the peach festival and were soo disappointed.  We went opening weekend and every tree had already been picked over and not by festival folks.  The ones left on the tree were unripe green peaches or rotten ones on the floor.  Everyone there was very, very dissappointed.  Such a cute place and such a great idea, really was too bad.  I would say 70% of the people there left empty handed."
1	"What a disappointment, don't waste your time and money and the gas to get there...."
2	"So this is the first time I've been here in what seems like 15 years and from what I remember a lot has changed. They have expanded tremendously. I went there for their Pumpkin and Chili Festival. The food was good and so were the attractions. It is very kid-oriented and it was just good clean fun (except the dust) but c'mon.... its a farm :) I just wish it wasn't so darn hot outside in mid October. Just bring some shades, sunscreen and a hat and you'll be set for a fun experience."
1	"My husband and I went to the Pumpkin and Chili Festival this weekend. I balked at the $15 admission fee per person, but we decided to give it a go anyway. \n\nThe highlight was the petting zoo, the animals were very sweet and I wanted to take all the pygmy goats home with me.\n\nThis place is lacking in some serious ways though. The corn maze is not very challenging or really all that fun. Food is way over priced, they won't even let you bring in your own beverages and are pretty much forced to pay nearly $3 for a 16oz bottle of water.  \n\nDog agility show was canceled for the afternoon. Hey, I understand it's hot outside, but I stuck around for that 2:30 show. A notice at the entrance would have been helpful. \n\nRides were more for the kiddies. Only food we got was two bottles of water and we shared an ice cream. A two scoop bowl of ice cream for six dollars. \n\nI come from the Northeast and have been to my share of pumpkin festivals that didn't charge an admission fee or if they did it was only $5. I can only say I was ripped off.\n\nWe won't be going there again."
1	"Peach Festival 2012: Do not expect big plump peaches. The variety grown at this farm are small desert peaches. As of mid-May 2012, the majority of peaches were not yet tree ripened. If you hand pick, take time to search the orchard and find a tree with good fruit.\n\nFootwear recommendation... if you do the UPICK, wear something you don't care gets dirty... the peach orchard ground is unlevel dirt and patches of mud, so wearing nice footwear or flip flops is not recommended.\n\nThe peach pancake breakfast served on-site was generous with the pancakes, but stingy on the peach topping. The peaches used in the topping were unripe, somewhat crunchy, and required a sprinkling of sugar. Expect to stand in a long slow line for your serving.\n\nFree admission and parking, but higher prices for many of the peach related products and other items sold at this festival."
1	"This place is overrated, to say the least.  SInce it is a working farm it is somewhat messy.  The farmer's market store is VERY expensive.  The festivals they have are expensive as well, and somewhat \""touristy.\""  \n\nI know it is politically-correct to support the \""little guy\"", but in this day and age it is smarter to save your money & buy your produce at the grocery store.\n\nStay away!"
2	"Schnepf Farms provides a perfect family-friendly or date night atmosphere. Do the two go hand in hand? Not really, but Schnepf Farms does a great job attracting both! \n\nThe best time to visit Schnepf Farms is either during their Fall Festival, Chili Festival and their Peach Festival. During these times, there are a slew of fun activities. During your visit, you can ride a train, wander through the corn field maze, ride the carnival rides, listen to live music, purchase some sweets in the candy store and end your night with a delicious piece of homemade pie. This is a real working farm, so it's fun to just walk the length of the farm and enjoy an outdoor setting. \n\nThis is a fun spot to pick out a pumpkin during the Fall Festival. They have an extensive pumpkin patch where you can pick out your favorite pumpkin. My favorite time to visit is at dusk, then I can enjoy the evening...however, I go for a date night as opposed to a family-friendly activity, so your visit should vary based on the bedtime of your party."
2	"I really like Schnepf Farms as a cute relaxing place to go. We went in Feb for the peach blossoms. There's not a ton going on at that time, the rides and little village are closed, but we were more interested in wandering around and looking at the flowers. The train was running, which is just a slow train that meanders around the property. Relaxing for adults and thrilling for dogs (which they are more than happy to allow on). Bathrooms aren't nice but they are functional. There are a lot of cute little places to eat, and places for kids/dogs to play. As a working farm, it was a little unclear where we were supposed to and not supposed to go, or even when it closed, but the flip side to that is how relaxed the place was, no one was rushing us out the 'door'. \n\nI mainly liked it because they welcome leashed dogs year round, it's free to go, and it was something different to do. But if you go kinda off season like we did, you gotta be in the mood to entertain yourself."
1	"overpriced!!!  $16 to get in and you don't get much. Poorly laid out, only a couple of rides. You have to pay extra for a little train ride. I will never go again."
1	"We were so disappointed.  This place was so poorly ran.  We went Sunday 23rd of oct.  never had been before.  Will never go back.  Dirty unorganized long lines out of everything.  Food was horrible.  Very disappointing.  You would think for on month out of the year it would be grand.  Seems to me they are money hungry and really don't even care."
1	"$16 per adult is way overpriced. My wife and I went here for the \""Chili and Pumpkin Festival.\"" Just calling something a \""festival\"" doesn't make it a festival. How is it a festival? There were very few pumpkins to choose from to take home and after paying $32 to get in, why am I paying another $10 for a pumpkin? Not to mention the $5 snow cone. It's price gouging galore at this place! Unless you like children's rides I don't see how this place is worth $32 for a couple, when you aren't likely to stay more than a couple of hours here.\n\nOn the positive side, it was a beautiful day and there were many nice photo opportunities to be had at the corn fields. I just don't see the justification in the amount of money they are charging. Perhaps if you had kids and you took them there for a half day it might be more reasonable. I did notice that the place was lousy with kids and teens. Not good for couples, however, other than picking up a pumpkin for Halloween (which you can do many places) and some nice photo ops."
2	"My wife and I went yesterday on Memorial Day morning about 10:30 AM.  We almost didn't go because of various negative reviews on Yelp, but are glad we ignored them.  First of all this is not a gourmet restaurant, and it is not the plastic pristine Disneyland.\n\nIt is a family farm trying to get by in an urban setting.  So it's informal, and a throwback to older times.  In the 70's and 80's our family made a yearly pilgrimage to Queen Creek where there were many orchards (peach, apricot, grapes).  Now they are almost all gone except Schnepf.  We found the parking pretty easy, and the parking and admission is free.  Later in the day it might be more difficult don't know.\n\nThere are quite a few things for kids to do, petting zoo, train to ride out in the orchard, old tractors to climb on.  We saw lots of kids just using their imagination being in an old farm setting without video games.\n\nLots of people want the peach pancakes.  You need to get your ticket when you first get there because the serve a group every hour.  It's not well marked, but you can figure it out.  When you time comes, you stand in line with generally affable people and watch the crew make the pancakes with old fashion steel griddles that lower over hot coals.    You get a scope of fresh peach compote and a dollop of whipped cream and a sausage patty.  The small size there is one of everything and the large there is two.  My wife and I split the small size and had plenty, so it was all of $6 for delicious peach pancakes.  With free parking and admission it was not a big investment.  Portions are large enough you can easily share with kids to reduce cost.\n\nWe of course also had to have the peach pie with soft serve ice cream.  Would have liked hard ice cream, but understand with this many people it would probably be impossible.  There were lots of food options around, with your standard hamburgers and hot dogs cooked over coals, BBQ etc.  There are quite a few places to sit, and most have shade as well.\n\nThere were no more good peaches in the orchard, but we were at the end of a long three day weekend, so that was not unexpected.  Their advice was to come early on Saturday.  I think they open different areas of the orchard each week, which have different varieties that ripen at different times.  \n\nWe enjoyed it."
1	"What a mess! Over an hour just to park on the road. Inside was a congestion of people among lines of vendor booths and no one to point you to ANY of the food advertised on tv! Settled for expensive burgers/dogs with hot soda cans and chips.  In the store there were lines everywhere and no one helping except behind the counter to get your pastry and money.  Expensive everything and none of the fun shown in an empty farm on tv news!  Wish they would go to show the mess it is with 100's of people trying to have a good time!  We will go North/ South for better run and more fun festivals! Bring stroller/wagon for the long hike back to the car if you have kids. We helped carry bags for a guest so she could carry her hot, tired and crying girl back to the car!  Best part was meeting them!"
1	"Terribly terribly disappointing. WAY WAY WAY over priced. $62 yes sixty two dollars for myself and 3 small children to get in! The staff at the front did face painting clearly stating they took tips.. Uh- I'm going to pay you to paint a tiny pumpkin on my child's face that took you all of 10 seconds? Wow- I'm clearly in the wrong line of work- the guy even had the nerve to tell me there were places I could get money and he'd be here all day! No thank you!!!! Oh- admission also did NOT include train ride, or picking pumpkins and food started at $8 and sno cones were $5? A lot of it was run down- dirty and very out of date- signs broken, not well kept . for $62 we rode a roller coaster, swings, an airplane toddler ride, a trampoline and got lost in the corn maze. There were absolutely no signs in the maze to help families with small children- we made our own path finally and ended up on a dirt road. I left with no pumpkins and very disappointed children. While my review will not stop anyone from going to Schnepf  I will not return or support it as a small business, neither will I recommend it as a must see place ... Save your money!"
1	"It honestly makes me sad to see all of these 5 star reviews for the place.\n\nMoving on, I was excited to take my kids to the pumpkin festival here. The website makes it look so fun and festive, but that is absolutely not what you get. I come from Utah and have been to many pumpkin festivals. I was shocked at the cost of admission($39 for a family of four, one of which was free because he's under 2 bought in advance with a discount) but we justified it thinking that everything is included so we would just be paying for food. We also do like to support local businesses. I, however, do not like being ripped off. It was hot, dusty, and boring. The rides had tremendously long waits and were boring. My 1.5 year old was bored on the kid rides...that says something. They are also slightly terrifying because they look like they are about to fall apart. The petting zoo was crowded and the only animals you can pet are the goats. I felt bad for them because there were just way too many people. There are absolutely no signs on the pathways so we had to turn around at dead ends constantly. The pumpkins were few and were just sitting on the ground. You do not get to go out in the field and pick your own. The prices are incredibly steep, considering that we paid $39 to get in. $20 for a large pumpkin that would cost $5 at the grocery store. I expect to pay more at an event like that but not after paying such a hefty admission. The bathrooms were down right disgusting, and I am not one of those weird bathroom people. My idea of a pumpkin festival is a lot of fall festivity, getting to go out in the field and picking out your own pumpkin (with wagons) and paying by the pound, and maybe having a bowl of chili and hot apple cider for a reasonable price. I'll repeat: I like supporting local businesses. However, this place is a business and is not a charity. If anyone gave it 5 stars they are seriously missing out and need to go elsewhere to see what  a decent pumpkin festival is all about."
1	"My family and I decided to go to Schnepf Farms instead of others in our area. We decided to make the 53 mile trek both ways because it was popular. It was expensive- tickets and food. If you don't pay extra to go on their rides, you'll be bored. In the spirit of the holiday season my sister and I decided to splurge and purchase a large pumpkin. We hauled it all the way to our car and 53 miles back home, started carving only to realize it was COMPLETELY MOLDED. In fact, some of the seeds had even sprouted. So not only did we not get to go out in a field and harvest our own pumpkin (we got it in the front of the farm on a table) but the pumpkin was worthless and had to be thrown away. Sorry Schnepf, but my family and friends won't be returning."
1	"Don't get me wrong, it's a cute place for families and kids but the parking was a bit unorganized and the prices were a little steep for entrance and all the extras inside. We went for the Pumpkin & Chili party and I couldn't believe what they were charging for the food. I will say that I had a nice evening with the friends I went with even though we seriously almost got lost in the corn maze! It wouldn't hurt to try this place for another event to update my review... until then it gets a 2.5 stars from me!"
2	"Absolutely love this farm, full of organic vegetables. Peaches are delicious, fudge and canned goods are divine too."
1	"The chili dinner consisted of a bowl of chili, corn bread, corn on the cob, a small brownie, and a drink. we ordered 2 and it cost 28$. I would not mind that price if the food was good, but it wasn't.\n\nIf you have children and that's the only reason you go there then I guess I can understand the hype. All the rides and entertainment are geared for them.\n\nThis is only for children, it is not for adults..... you have been warned."
2	"I did not come during any festival, as I know those times this place is massively packed.  I went during the normal hours on a saturday.  Parking was fine, with no entrance fee.  I walked in to the store at the entrance to get some of their snacks.  They have great cinnamon buns, brownies, and other things they make right there with their own stuff.  I also picked up some pumkin butter they made there as well.  The largest thing for me was going into their pick-yourself harvesting.  Grab a bucket and walk to the field, and pick whatever you want!  Only $1.50/pound, and I walked out with $2.60 worth of vegetables which was enough for 2 people to eat for two days.  Everything is organically grown as well, which made washing the produce so easy.  Spinach, cauliflower, sweet peas, lettuce, broccoli, and a couple of other things.  I'm definitely coming back on a weekly basis while I can and getting my fill of vegetables!\n\nOne thing to remember when coming to this place is that it's a farm, not an amusement park.  There are things that may resemble an amusement park such as a train, roller coaster, and petting zoo... but remember above all that when you enter it's a working farm.  Also remember that every action you perform can destroy plants, so watch where you're walking and don't pull them out of the ground :-)  Also... please... control your children...."
1	"I really do not get this place.  Tiniest peaches I ever saw, thick skins that aren't edible.  Just awful.  The peaches on the news show that got me there looked great. Were the normal peaches in a different part of the farm? Did they substitute peaches from the store for the news show?\n\nAlso did not appreciate the sales people asking me if I had signed up for something or other 4 times while I was there. Obnoxious."
1	"This place is so overpriced!  The breakfast menu is a complete rip-off, while the atmosphere is enjoyable, what you pay to eat vs. what you get on your plate is completely unreasonable.  We tried going back one other time in the fall to look for a pumpkin and were told we would have to pay to enter (even though we didn't have kids and only wanted to buy a pumpkin) We will never go back, and have grown to loathe this place because of the traffic it produces"
1	"Was here today for the Peach Festival and could not believe how rude the lady making the pancakes was! I think this is Carrie Schnepf since she was the one I saw on the news. I was standing over by the refrigerator where the water bottles are kept looking for a sign posted stating the price of a water bottle. I had made brief eye contact with her and she screamed, \""What??!\"" and threw her hands up in the air obviously annoyed by my very presence. I was so appalled and just responded with asking how much the water was. Then she screamed \""$2.00!!\"". \n\nMaybe she is a nice person, I don't know but I do know that is no way to treat a customer that contributes to keeping your business alive. A little kindness and courtesy is all I'm asking for - especially from the owner and especially after paying $12.00 for pancakes I could have made better myself.\n\nOther than that it was a pretty fun day. I do think the farm could use some overall clean up. There were just random objects laying around every where that didn't appear to have much purpose. Just makes the place a little junky looking."
2	"We went to Schnepf Farms for the Peach Festival this past year and it was a great experience.  We picked our own peaches, tasted many different products made with their peaches, and even enjoyed the peach pancake breakfast.  I haven't yet been here during any other part of the year, but it's definitely worth a trip out during peach season."
1	"Not worth the 17 dollars per person just to get in. You dont even get to go out to the patch to cut your own pumpkins, you \""pick\"" from a \""patch\"" (aka a pile of pre picked pumpkins). Overpriced and overrated!"
2	"I loved it here however it's difficult to find if you've never been there. Here are a few tips as well: bring your own drinks, wear comfortable shoes (walking all day), avoid going at night, and bring your own sanitizer to wash hands! I came at 7pm and even 3 hours wasn't  enough to check out everything! You can spend a whole day here! Kids loved it! I live in mesa so it was worth the drive!"
1	"We went for October Chili fun at night with our family. It was a nice farm, although not worth the 18 dollars per person 2 and older! We had a coupon so at least that helped. There were carnival games, jumping pillows, pig races, all for little ones. The pony rides and train ride were extra, which should be included! My LO was excited to go on the bubble bee rides, didn't make a good impression when the operator of the ride says \""this is an old ride, some of the bees don't do up and down.\"" and ours didn't. Just 2 out of the 12 worked.   my LO went on about 3 rides, including a marry go round, walked around, paid for cotton candy and jumped on pillows .for 40 dollars. That's just really overpriced. Also eat before going, it's really expensive for a bowl of chili and 6 bucks for a hotdog. Overall nice family night but disappointed with the amount of money you paid with little we got!"
1	"Scheduled a birthday party for a 3 year old with family, friends, and a bunch of little kids. The family booked over 3 weeks ago. Got here and found none of the things promised and stated they don't provide that package in October. So no food and drink provided or hostess as promised. Talked to the owner who claimed he explained everything to the father of the birthday boy, which is not true and basically threw the dad under the bus because of course the dad wasn't standing there. Soooo ethical. In the end he tried to make it right but still. Be for warned when you reserve this place."
1	"Came for the pumpkin festival. It is a pretend patch. The pumpkins are in a dirt field with stickers from the farm they came from - in Texas! This is one of the pricier fall festivals and I don't think I got my money's worth.  Petting Zoo was dirty (I know they are animals, but I've never been to a petting zoo that smelled so bad and had so much poop.) and the hand sanitizer dispensers were empty - only an hour after opening. Food is overpriced. Just not a lot for my toddler to do here. Recommend going to Dewey instead."
1	"Do not recommend this place. We had an issue with how an employee treated our child and all contact that we tried to make with Schnepf was ignored. They never returned emails or messages to resolve the situation. We will never return."
1	"Nothing at this location.  I would rather go elsewhere in Queen Creek.  It is not worth coming here."
2	"what can i say except....the word \""discount\"" when it applies to alcohol just freaking rocks!!!"
2	"Closed - So sad!"
2	"My only tip to them would be to use real guac, not that creamy taco bell crap like they gave me on today. If they would have - 5 stars cause my machaca chimi was dang good.  I enjoyed the machaca more then then anywhere else in the area.  I would suggest hitting this place up if you are in the mood for Mexican Food, and NOT Serranos .... My wife said her plate was 3 stars, but would come back and try more.  based on mine alone .... I will be back!"
2	"Four stars and 2 of them are for the price that includes great chips and salsa and free ice cream.\n the place is great for lunch and breakfast, kinda slow service and cheap diner food but worth the price tag.\nThe breakfast is great but slow and very local yokel crowd. The lunch burger is well worth 4 bux. DO NOT order a soda that is what kills the low prices. Decent Mexican food and decent American food as well.\nI am Italian so I may not be the best judge of Mexican as I think Taco Bell is ok. You can not beat the price and amount of food for breakfast, coffee sucks, pancakes rule!"
1	"First, service was great but the cheeseburgers weren't good. It's a shame because I can throw together a decent burger at home with some fresh ground beef and fresh buns. It's not rocket science! Not sure why these local places can't put a tiny more effort into their food to get repeat costumers. \nAlso, don't sit near the kitchen because they have a noisy machine (ice, maybe?) and it's impossible to have a conversation."
2	"Great chips and Salsa - Great free ice cream at end of meal.\n\nNice down home feel - been in Queen Creek for over two decades.\n\nI love the chicken enchiladas with green sauce -\n\nBut also there hamburgers and fries are a huge portion you can share with  a friend for fairly cheap.\n\nMeet there regular with folks.\n\nPastor Ben Cloud\nAMADEO Church"
1	"Normally we do not do bad reviews, but this was so bad and customers should be warned.\nMy husband called in a pick up order that should have been ready by the time he got there, it wasn't. he was greeted and told it would just be a few minutes because they were fixing the his order. 10-15min later his food was ready and he was told his total was $84 ( the order was 3 hard tacos and two burritos) he said \""thats not right\"" the cashier said \""ya that's the total\"", he again said \""no\"" and she then fixed it with help for another worker. he then paid $30+ for the order and left 20min after arriving.\nOnce home the food was cold, the hard tacos were all soft tacos, the chicken burrito was unflavored shredded chicken and that's it there was absolutely nothing else inside and the chicken wasn't even seasoned, and the carne asada was like a normal burrito just cold, salsa was good, chips were just dry chips.\nMy husband called to explain that all the food was wrong even after he had already waited for them to \""fix it\"" when he arrived to pick it up. he was passed to three different people and the responses he received was no better then anything else. They said the don't give grande tacos as hard shells even though he clearly ordered hard and they stated that their chicken burrito is just shredded chicken roll up as a burrito in a tortilla. They said the carne asada burrito is a special burrito that's why it came with other stuff inside of it. The menu does not state what they say, so please be very careful when ordering so that you don't get surprise like we did with my dry shredded chicken in a tortilla. \nWe would have loved some apologies for the poor service and food but instead we received excuses and statements that this is how it is. We threw out most of the food, wasted $30, and we will not ever be back to Rudy's:("
2	"I have had breakfast and lunch here. Sausage and biscuits are great and their Mexican food is good as well. I would give 5 stars, but it needs an over haul on the decor for sure!"
1	"We were driving through town and chose this place based on other Yelp reviews and this is really the first time a highly rated dive didn't pan out for us.  \n\nFirst the good:\n- Very friendly and attentive service:  never had our water/drink glasses empty\n- If you are a sports fan, they have 2 TVs and were showing different NFL games when we went there (Sunday lunchtime)\n- The portions are definitely generous.\n\nNow the average:\n- The pricing really isn't that good to be honest.  For a family of 4 we paid $50 and didn't order any adult beverages or appetizers.  Frankly we can pay that in Scottsdale.\n- While the service was very attentive, the food took a little time to come out, and it wasn't super busy in the restaurant.  It wasn't a major flaw, but I did find myself wondering where the food was for a little while.\n\nNow the poor:\n- The food...just not good at all.  I found the refried beans to not be fresh or tasty.  Really seemed store bought to me.\n- The sour cream tasted awful.  I had to scrape it off my food.\n- The guacamole was mediocre at best - again seemed store bought.  My 11-year old daughter's guacamole blows this away!\n- The chicken seemed very low quality...definitely dark meat.  It was seasoned fairly well, probably because of the low quality.\n\nThe decor is dated, but honestly that wasn't an issue for us.  Most of the time dives like this with high Yelp ratings have some of the best food...just not in this case.  I really like to support local businesses, but unfortunately this is not a place I'd try again.  Sorry."
2	"We really enjoyed this place.  Not curbside appeal or interior ambiance but no great Mexican restaurant I've ever dined at has. Outstanding service in terms of friendliness which made up for some of the forgetfulness.  Good chips but salsa needs to be much spicier as it is a little amateurish :-). My food was outstanding. Rudy, the owner, stopped by our table to say high and he was very friendly and interesting. I'd return."
2	"Great authentic food and even better service. Beer and wine are available and hit the spot. The staff is so friendly!"
1	"It was a Saturday about 5pm when My wife 2 boys and I walked in and there was only a few other groups in the restaurant. We asked if they had margaritas and the waitress said they only had margaritas In a pouch which seemed odd. We ordered our food and 30 mins later we noticed they were just bringing out another group's food. We asked the waitress about our food and she said it was going to be another 15 minutes. We told her that was too long and we would just leave. The owner walked it and didn't say one word to us. As we were walking to our car we noticed the owner taking to bags of food out to his vehicle. I would suggest never going here!"
2	"Been shopping at Russes for 15 years... Old store to new store still my favorite  hardware store..."
2	"I have been here a few times and went in today to fill some propane bottles. These guys are much cheaper than any of the other places and on top of that, if you have a rewards card, you receive a further discount off their already cheaper propane.\n\nOne of the guys took my bottles back for me and even though their tank was in the middle of being filled, they filled mine right up and I was done in no time.\n\nThe other times I have been there I have experienced nothing but knowledgeable staff whom are more than willing to help."
2	"I've yet to have a bad experience at Johnson Ranch. I consider it my home course since I play it the most. I love trying out new courses but always come to JR on a whim or if I don't feel like driving all over the place. You can't beat the $25 price from June-August. Really. I know it's hot and all that, but that's why you get on by 7 and get off by 11. Plus, that's what the beer cart lady is for. (And they're both quite the lookers if I do say so myself. Then again it could be the heat exhaustion giving me sunstroke goggles, but I'm pretty sure they're both yummy. You're welcome).\n\nLike the other reviews said, the back 9 is awesome. Really, it's what makes it worth playing, makes it worth the drive, the price and all that. The restaurant is very tasty and the patio is a nice spot to hang out at after a game to shoot the breeze. The breakfast is great if you get there for an early tee time and to my experience, the staff (yes, all of them) are friendly, helpful, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent. Stuff that in your pipe and smoke it!!"
2	"A very well maintained, moderately priced course.  Classic AZ course, the front nine is nestled within a golf home community.  Holes have a nice combination of fescue and brush lined fairways, with bunkers placed in challenging spots.  Can easily play bunker to bunker but still have a great time.  The back nine has more ups and downs as some holes are placed along the foothills of the areas.  Saguaros and roadrunners double as hazards along the course.\n\nNice placement of tee times as we never waited at a tee box, and played the full round around 4.25 hours.  Taco salad at the clubhouse wasn't bad either!\n\nWould definitely play here again."
1	"Wow, I have never received worse customer service than here.  Set up a tee time for a saturday morning round of gold with some buddies from college.  It had rained all week and was raining the morning of our reservation and was about 40 degrees at 6 am.  I wore a collared shirt and blue jeans due to the cold.  Mind you, I understand the need for a dress code at nice golf courses to keep the riff raff out.  My jeans were presentable, my shirt was a nice polo, and NOWHERE on the website does it state no denim, only the need for a collared shirt. When I arrived, I met Mike, who is the cashier at the clubhouse.  From the second I walked in the door, Mike started harrasing me about my jeans, telling me I could not play yet would still have to pay because of the 24 hour cancellation policy.  Mike was extremely rude and unwilling to have a rational discussion about the \""unposted\""dress policy. 10 fays later, they charged my credit card I had used to reserve the time for $240 which I disputed.  I, for one, will never golf here again although I have played at Johnson Ranch several times while in school.  The course is average.  First nine holes can be found anywhere for less money, back nine is nice although all the building of houses has diminished its appeal. If you value any type of customer service for your hard earned money, look elsewhere.  Superstition Springs is much nicer for the price in my opinion."
1	"I have never met a clubhouse manager as rude as here at Johnson ranch.   I understand you dont make the rules dude, but we are still paying $280 for a round of golf for my family and I should be treated with kindness and respect, not contempt.   Don't expect any of your family or friends to be able to accompany you on a round to watch. This is the first course in hundreds where my disabled wife was required to pay a green fee for a round of gold just to ride along in the cart as a passenger.  Unbelievable.    I will not be back.  They do have a pretty back nine, but I couldn't enjoy it after being treated so rudely."
1	"This course has an ok layout and a couple holes with nice views, however it doesn't make up for a rude staff that pushed us every other hole to keep a faster pace. They talked down to us and were being rude. Not even one \""hello, are you having a good time?\""  No courtesy at all, just rudeness. On a Sunday early morning we maintained a 4 1/2 hr pace while having to search for our balls in monsoon casual water collection areas and high rough. We let a 3 some play through and were not pushed much from behind, yet the staff kept harrassing us and threatening to make us skip a hole. What?? I have never had this experience at another course even if there was slow play that day.  Here, it wasn't even crowded yet they kept annoying us. What an unenjoyable day and waste of gas money to drive all the way out there.  Never again.  The 1 star is just for 3 nice holes on the mountainside, otherwise i'd try giving negative stars."
1	"Ok course, nice driving range.\nFront 9 is boring, back 9 is more scenic and better quality with the exception of 1 tricked up goofy hole.\nI wouldn't pay a cent over $39.99."
1	"Great course! However the locals (old people that could only afford to live on a golf course in BFE) think they run the place. The bartenders are pretty rude, as are the annoying messages they send your cart every hole (ex. Keep up with the group ahead... The same group you are caught up w and waiting on). They definitely over schedule the Tee times. I will say the course staff (rangers, food service) were great."
1	"Decent coarse, greens were a little fast as they were a little under watered.  The place is definitely a little over priced and snooty for it's location........  You are a golf course in San Tan Valley, the attitude and prices would be expected up in Snottsdale, but not in the middle of the freaking desert...."
1	"Need some new help. The older guys working there are very rude. I played this month and two guys that worked part time just got off working and jumped in front of us. Then to cap it off one guy had is dog with him on the cart and let him run around while he putting."
2	"I've lived in The QC for 6 years now and never knew about this place.  Water-N-Ice has been at this location for 8 years!?!?!  New owners recently and they had the good idea of putting up A-frame signs on Ellsworth and Power roads.  We saw the Ellsworth sign on a trip to hike the San Tan Mountains and decided to take the crew there after the hike/tailgate dinner.\n\nIf you blink you might miss it.  The complex has other businesses but not the type that will be open in the evening most of the time.  There is a Karate place in the same complex.  This is on the South side of San Tan Blvd, just East of The Deli (also an awesome place if you haven't tried it).\n\nI had to make sure it was bonafide Thrifty ice cream provider and as soon as I saw Chocolate Malted Crunch on the list, it was valid :-).  Great, friendly owners and 2 tables and a couch for some leisure sitting.  We had a group of 4 families with kids and everyone was happy.  Price for 2 scoop cone ice cream at time of our visit was about $2.10.  Can't beat it.\n\nIf you need water, of course they have that :-) -- looked like about 6-8 filling stations *inside* and one outside for 24-hour access.  I asked about RV water fill and the owner had just installed a hose bib outside so that if you wanted you could pull around.  He doesn't have a way to meter it though, so he's being a trusty business man and asking you know your tank size before filling.\n\nGreat to have found this place after living here so long.  Now I won't have to drive very far to get my choc malted crunch fix!"
2	"I am doing my best to not eat a lot of sugar anymore, but I had a bite of my daughters cookies & cream ice cream and I must say it is the best cookies and cream ice cream I have ever had.  \n\nThis place is family owned and operated and everything is homemade.  Very good selection.  My son had a shake and drank it up, while another son had the bubblegum ice cream ... he devoured it.  \n\nAll the kids said it was the best ice cream they have ever had (they say that anytime I take them anywhere though) but I had to do a review and add my .02 because I did try it .. .and it was amazing and its a little hole in the wall you would never know.  \n\nOn Yelp and when you drive by its just a place where you think you get water and ice.  Luckily they have started putting out signs directing people.  They are close to \""The Deli\"" the diamond eatery in Queen Creek, so I think they should piggy back off their success and do whatever they can to be more visible on Yelp or other location based social networks.  More people need to know about this place and that is why I am writing this review - I am doing my part!  Now enjoy Queen Creek!!"
2	"This is a great little Mexican place... Very authentic. No indoor seating, but plenty of picnic tables under a covered patio.  The owners are building a new restaurant across the street that already looks very grand, even though it has not even been completed yet.  The new restaurant will have the same quality and lots of indoor seating and even live music on the weekends. \n\nDefinitely give this place a try if you are out in the Queen Creek area."
1	"I was recommended to El Rico's by a co-worker. My husband and I were thinking of going somewhere else, but then the co-worker said she is spoiled at El Rico's and does not find anywhere else as good. So I thought we should give it a try. My husband loves authentic Mexican food and considers himself a good judge at finding a worthy place, and unfortunately they did not pass the test. The ambience is nice on the outside, the inside is a little too cafeteria like, not quite restaurant style. I will give them credit for the ceiling, very dramatic d\u00e9cor (but that's not what I'm eating off of). The salsa was amazing, definitely my choice in dips. However the chips are way too thick, that's just a preference though. The food was not as strong tasting as we would like, my husband said it was like eating water but I think that's over exaggerating. I didn't mind the food too much, although I still left hungry (ordered the flauta plate). But, are you ready for the kicker? The taco my husband ordered still had the wire piece in it that holds it together during frying. Cooking 101 do not leave metal shards in food.\nWait a second, I just looked up their website and they have the inside all decorated. Don't let that fool you. When we went the tables were bare and sticky. I was going to give them 2 stars but just decided on 1 for the false advertising. Fine dining experience my butt. We went early so it was not crowded and  yet service was still slow, although polite."
2	"El Rico's is one of my favorite local restaurants. It's very close by and I love the way they have laid out the outside and upper floor. My girlfriend and I have gone here a few times and each time the food has been great and we have had plenty to eat. Their prices are reasonable and you can eat for nearly the same price you could at any fast-food joint. At night, the whole place really lights up and transforms the mood. Since it's out in the countryside, the stars can be seen at night and during the day, the Santan Mountains can be seen from the many windows. \n\nThe staff are also on the spot, several times we finished the chip bowl and they had a new one to us just as we finished each of them. The salsa is great and you can really tell that it's authentic Mexican style. Plus, when our food arrived we were very surprised to see how much you get for the price. I got the chicken quesadilla and the cheese and chicken tasted fantastic. The few times we have gone there, we always needed a box to take home the remainder of our portions. \n\nIf you enjoy a good date, I recommend going during the night; the whole environment changes from their well laid out lighting. Right now the weather is perfect to enjoy stargazing outside while enjoying some delicious food. \nIf you are interested in taking a group, they can accommodate you with everything up to fine dining with candle light. The second story gives an alternative view to the Santan Mountains and the surrounding area. \n\nThe only disappointment I had was their lack of waiting service. However, after you order at the counter they do bring you you're food and make sure everything is enjoyable and tasting great. I heard that they may be adding waiting service in the near future however, either way it is still a great place that's both visually and tastefully stunning."
2	"This restaurant is in a bit of a transition. Downstairs is a cafeteria style experience that has been the standard for the restaurant. Recently the restaurant received a liquor license and started full service upstairs. Our server was very friendly and described all of the proposed changes including closing up the upstairs, but making the roofing retractable so that it could be opened on nice days. \n\nThe views from upstairs were great - despite not much in the surrounding area to look at other than ran down buildings. At least the mountains provided a good view. The linens on the table and full service made it a wonderful experience. The food was good too - we started with the freshly made guacamole. It was just as good as Cafe Laredo, but half the price. I went with a margarita for $8, which really I could skip. I ordered frozen, but didn't get it and in general it was just kind of average. The chips were very good and the salsa very good. I ordered the beef taco with carne asada - which was surprisingly really spicy. I finished with dessert - the churros and the newly introduced sundae - neither were really impressive. \n\nWhile the service was friendly and knowledgeable, the server was a bit slow. I am sure that will improve as they get more experience with the full service. The entree and the app was exceptional - skip the drink and dessert and it would be perfect. Overall it was just over $50, but subtract the $8 drink, the price for the churro and sundae and it would be a good meal at a good price. \n\nWhile the bar isn't very high, this is definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Queen Creek. I will be back frequently."
2	"Ran into this place by accident and we stopped for lunch. The best part for me was the chips and salsa. Amazing flavor. I had the fajitas and wow what a plate full. I think I could get 3 meals out of it! My only disappointment was the tortilla shells. Although they came to the table very warm, they were very dry. The food's flavor was good and our server was attentive and pleasant. I will for sure come back when it is cooler and we can sit outside on the beautiful patio or upstairs open air dining."
1	"This place USED to be good. We went there yesterday afternoon and everything was cold and tasted stale. To make our experience even better my husband had to get his own refill since our waiter never bothered to check if we needed any and when we asked for more salsa when our food came our waiter said he'd get it for us, a little while later still no salsa so my husband got up to look for our waiter to ask him for it and he said \""in a minute I'm really busy\""....WOW!!! I wouldn't be so irked if it were a packed restaurant but there was seriously only 1 other table there and I counted at least 4 if not 5 people working there...1 of them could've bothered to check to make sure if we had drinks and/or chips and salsa but obviously that was expecting way too much. Like I said they used to be good but the past few times I've been there their quality has been going down and this last experience was the last straw. Of course they are also very pricey...10.50 for 2 tacos beans and rice and the tacos are SMALL. I never thought Don Pedros which is 10 minutes away was that great but unfortunately Don Pedros is now better than this place :("
2	"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  I was a little hesitant because I am picky about my food...and well, especially because I am Mexican and restaurant food is too gringo for me!  BUT-This place is insaaaaane.  The salsa was AWESOME.  Guacamole...AWESOME.  I am VERY particular about my rice because many restaurants cannot make rice that is acceptable.  Here at El Rico's?  AWESOME.  The beans are hands down phenomenal to boot.  I ordered the soft tacos and tamales and well, they reminded me of home.  \n\nIncidentally, the wait on a weekend is a simple 20 or 30 minutes...but WORTH IT.  The staff is friendly and the patio divine.  \n\nMy advice:Give it a go.  If not...yay!  More for me and less of a wait!!"
2	"I have now been to El Rico's several times and thought it was time to give it a review. I went last night with a small group, and had another great experience. \n\nAlthough I usually get the same thing when I go (shredded beef gordo burrito...2 meals in 1), it's awesome each time. They do have great chips and salsa to start off with, and everyone I've been with has always enjoyed their food. The service has always been good to great. Although it is kind of in a weird location, the building it is in is definitely unique. We've always wanted to go in the evening when it is cooler out to sit outside, but have never made it. El Rico's is its own place, which makes it cool...it's not a cookie-cutter restaurant. It's my favorite mexican place out here."
2	"This is not just a carniceria it is also a post office. I originally came here because I have a po box and pick up my mail. Now, I kill two birds with one stone: pick up my mail and some marinaded meat to grill for tacos. It is simply delicious and their salsa is good too. I haven't tried anything else but I might today :) the customer service is awesome and they are very welcoming. Try this place out either for a quick bite or bring some home to grill."
1	"This place is really kind of a cool old school carniceria that I really wanted to like. The people that work there are great and really friendly. The post office in back is a nice touch as well. Being a breakfast burrito fanatic, I simply had to try their burros. Yesterday morning I went and ordered several bacon and chorizo. Was asked if wanted potatoes, sure I said, I didn't realize would be an upcharge but that's ok. When I got the burros home they were basically all potato. It reminded me of a baked potato with a tortilla wrapped around. The salsa was watery. I believe there was MAYBE 1 strip of bacon in each gi-normous burrito- nearly non existent. The chorizo was about the same, very very little meat. I could overlook this to some extent if they weren't $6.95 each. I have never in my life paid that kind of money for a breakfast burro. I think the worst thing was the price. You can go to anywhere in Phoenix and get a great burro for 5 bucks. The dichotomy is that you are going into like this hole in the wall/dive type of place, which I love, but then to pay high end prices. Really weird. Will not be going back."
2	"Such a cool little hole-in-the-wall. I always go here when I want to make some authentic Mexican cuisine. They've got some good fresh vegetables for salsa, guacamole, fajitas, you name it. The pre-marinated Carne asada is just awesome!"
2	"Friendly front desk staff and a solid room for an affordable price.  They also have a pretty solid free breakfast bar."
1	"I've been very pleasantly surprised by most HIE properties, but this one was a real disappointment.  The list of problems include:\n - we booked a room with a King bed, and got one with 1 queen.  \n - when we mentioned that at checkin, the desk attendant argued with us about what kind of bed it was, which it's pretty obviously a queen.\n - the sheets are threadbare and really not up to the normally-luxurious standards of HIE.\n - the pillows, even the \""firm\"" ones, are as soft as a bag of laundry.  When we asked for more, we were told they were out.\n - the coffee maker doesn't work.\n - the smoke detector is hanging from the wall by a couple of wires.\n - the shower has a particularly slow drain.\n\nNow, some of these are nitpicks, I know, but the lack of interest on the hotel's staff to address these issues has been a serious disappointment, and I really feel like we're staying at an overpriced Super 8 rather than a Holiday Inn Express, which, as I've said before, has normally been a real pleasure to patronize."
1	"Not a kid friendly hotel at all!!! Pool the size of a tub heater broken no jacuzzi!!!"
1	"I have never, NEVER given a Holiday Inn a one star rating. However, this places stinks! It's dirty. When we walked in, we immediately noticed smudges on the mirrors and a dire need for a fresh paint of coat on just about everything. The sheets had a weird smell, but I'm sure they were clean, albeit poorly. The tub barely drained; I had to keep turning it off before continuing my shower because I was standing in a pool of water. Personally, that grosses me out, but that could be just me. It is also worth mentioning that I take quick showers...\n\nThe people are nice and the blueberry muffins at the breakfast buffet are really good. This is odd for a Holiday Inn Express, so while I will continue to stay at this chain, I will not return to this location."
1	"Last week I was told that my radiator hoses on our 2008 Honda Accord needed to be replaced because they showed a lot of wear, getting soft, could go anytime, especially with Arizona's heat. I called back this past Wednesday to set an appt to flush my coolant and replace the hoses andwas quoted from Dave McCombs, the store manager, that I should replace the thermostat at the same time. Their price for doing these 3 things was well over $500. Being somewhat suspicious of their price and recommendations, I opted to go to Tempe Honda and get second opinion. According to their service writer my radiator hoses were in great shape and typically didn't need replacing for at least 10 years and he could never remember replacing a thermostat on a Honda Accord. Tempe Honda's  price for flushing the coolant was a mere $69.95 and they even washed my car prior to me picking it up. \nI only need to be burned once from an auto repair shop and I'm happy that I got a second honest opinion. As far as I'm concerned, Sun Devil Auto repair in Sun Lakes are rip-offs, trying to take advantage of anyone looking to do business with them."
1	"$96.00 diagnostic charge was not removed after the corrective procures were performed. Nonsense and bad business practice. This has never happened to me before and is unacceptable to me. There are competitors a little further away that don't apply this charge. There's still about $2,000 unrelated work to do on the car and the business is going elsewhere. Hopefully, they will get the message."
1	"These guys are not fair with price..they markup the parts too much and charge labor rates similar to dealerships. Took it elsewhere and saved 30%"
2	"Excellent Health care\n\nThis is a family practice but the cater mostly to geriatric patients, but they are skilled in everything your family needs.  Most of your lab work can be done in house at most times sames day (no appointment/copay).  \nThe PA and NP's are excellent and you will not see a big difference in care.  This is a large practice and very busy, but you will not feel rushed when you get your time with the health professionals.\nThey try to do as much care as they can for patients rather than making you see a specialist, but they know when referrals are needed."
1	"Don't go here. They schedule appointments and when you get there, they don't have you in their calendar. The office manager Lori has no customer service skills. They don't resolve issues with a satisfactory solution, they resolve it at YOUR expense. Your time is worth nothing to them. They are always late seeing patients and make you wait for long periods of time. Don't waste your time here. The only thing going for this low tech office is the doctors and nurse practitioner are good but the office is run inefficiently. They also make coding errors and any mistakes made on their part is always going to be YOUR PROBLEM!!!"
2	"I think the front desk could be a little more organized and professional.  I am not done of being called hon by a total stranger.\n\nLuckily, the back office more than makes up for the front.  Tony, the nurse practitioner listens and she's the time you need."
2	"Best place around for the Flu Shot! Thanks for making my arm sore..."
1	"They helped me but not really. I was asking about my a/c unit and they kinda were confused or something. Or maybe I was either way i did not get the right answers or products."
2	"I recently went to this Autozone because my check engine light was on.  While I was waiting to be helped, I had noticed one of the employees outside helping an older gentleman replace something, maybe a headlight.  When they were finished, I noticed they shook hands and the customer left very happy.  Then, it was my turn.  I told the employee, Randy, why I was in and he immediately came out to check the codes.  While we were out there, I mentioned to him that I wanted to address this issue so I could then fix the whistling sound I was hearing from the engine. Randy immediately asked me to pop the engine so he could take a look.  Within a minute, he identified the problem.  Without my asking, he said he'd be back & returned with a replacement hose, installing it for me.  It was then that I realized this type of service was just protocol for Randy.  He truly enjoys helping others.  A side benefit is he is the reason why customers will return.\n\nMany times when visiting autoparts stores, it seems to me that the employees are disinterested in helping their customers really understand and resolve their concerns.  Their role is to solely identify the correct replacement part and sell it to you.  After this, you are on your own.  \n\nIf you are lucky enough to visit this Autozone while Randy is working, I am confident you will leave a more informed & satisfied customer.  Thanks, Randy, for putting in the little extra effort that makes a big difference!!"
1	"Was very unhappy after just going yesterday. My husband dropped off our battery to see if it needed recharged and we said we would be back in a couple hours. \""we are trying to see if we had a bad battery or alternator\"" ..... so I come back to get battery the guy goes what kind of battery you have... i say I dont know my husband brought it in. I asked do you guys put a name on them, he goes usually then brings me a battery thinking it's mine.... i then asked how do you know if its mine .. he goes it must be ... I then called my husband and he said we had a walmart battery... this one was but just the attitude and not caring wether they gave me the right battery or not made me never want to go there again... even the manager on duty did not seem to care .. like well here is a battery and its good so be on .. like I was annoying him .... long story short always loved auto zone .......but not this one ....."
1	"I never thought I would be one of those people who wrote a bad review about a business. However ever since PB bell took over Montage, I have been so frustrated with them,  Four different times! Now i just cant wait to move out. When i moved into the property it was a Mark Taylor Community. When i found out PB Bell was taking over i was a little disappointed but didnt really care who the property management was. I used to be a Leasing Consultant for Mark Taylor so I know how the business works. The first month they took over, my $1400 rent payment (money order) was \""lost\"". I believe it was carelessly thrown away since they received my updated information, which was in the envelope with my payment. I have paid rent the same way ever since i have lived here, on the 3rd at night i drop it in the drop box. July 3rd I walked down to drop my payment to find out they closed the drop box! Irritating because I work 7 days a week during the day & don't have the option to make it into the office during business hours. So i did what Mark Taylor said to do, \"" as long as we have your payment before 9am before the 4th your payment is not late\"". As you all know businesses are closed July 4th so i had to wait until the 5th. Before 9am i tried to give my payment to the leasing staff. I have NEVER been late on my rent payment. However they would not accept my payment and unfairly slapped me with a $50 late fee that had to be in certified funds. I don't have a car so getting to the bank was another inconvenience thanks to them. This MONDAY morning all water was shut off & I wasn't able to shower before work. Then I go down to the business center after work to quickly type up an important document & it's only conveniently open during business hours! I can't wait to move!"
1	"Let's start with the fact they charge me 1200 for a 900sq ft apartment, let's end with me breaking my lease moving down the street and saving 4,800 a year.  Good job pb bell, keep up the good work.\n\nP.S. I really appreciate waiting in the office while you negotiate a car loan over the phone.\n\nStay classy"
1	"Ever since the new management company took over it's just gone downhill. They have closed down the clubhouse, the fitness center and now the pool (scheduled for July) already without notifying their residents in advance. There is no communication from either the management company (PB Bell) nor from the office staff. It really shouldn't be a surprise that so many long term residents are leaving - they're as sick of this as I am. It looks like it's time for me to move also ...."
1	"So I just received my lease renewal notice, 10 days before I have to decide to give my 60-day notice or not.  I asked them for this twice in the beginning of June.  I was told both times that the property manager was working on it.  Last year I got the renewal notice and returned it signed by the 8th of June!  Why the delay this year??\n\nNot only are they increasing my rent, but now they areimplementing a flat fee for the water bill.  So while my monthly water bill USAGE is about $15 a month, I now have to pay $30 a month for a one bedroom apartment!  Wtf?!?!?\n\nSeriously - the location is great, the apartments are decent, but the managment staff and their reponses to tenant's concerns is awful.  DO NOT RENT HERE!!"
1	"Visiting my mom in Chandler, I had a hankering for teriyaki. My mom said Mikado had a great lunch special, so we went.\n\nIf your idea of \""special\"" is warm spicy tuna rolls and chicken that tastes like someone made it in a toaster oven, then Mikado is pretty damn special.\n\nI like my teriyaki very saucy, very sweet and a bit charred. No such luck.\n\nI can't think of a single thing they did right.\n\nI suppose the price was OK: $7.95 for teriyaki, white rice, miso soup, a small salad and a four-piece spicy tuna."
2	"As a fan of MythBusters I am delighted to say I have officially busted a myth....there's no good sushi in Phoenix.  Not true--You can indeed find great sushi in Phoenix, Arizona (Chandler, to be more specific).  Stopped by Mikado for lunch today.  My very favorite way to take in a sushi date is by sitting at the counter and asking the artist behind the bar to send out suggestions.  It was recommended we start with some great blue fin tuna (hooray for October, as it is the beginning of the season).  Next up, a house specialty...Salmon Avocado Sashimi.  What makes it particularly great is the homemade Eel Sauce made in-house.  Delicately sweet and still lets the fish flavors come through.  We just had to finish up with the Dragon Roll to get our Unagi fix.  So glad we did.  We will definitely be back to Mikado (and by \""we\"" I mean my hard to please 15 year old son and me.)"
1	"This was the second sushi visit in one day for me, so I was really in the mood. I had heard good things about Mikado, but had never been.\n\nWe ordered tuna, yellowtail, and salmon nigiri, a angry cucumber salad (which was described as \""spicy\""), a kimchi roll, and eel nigiri.\n\nThe tuna was mealy in texture, the yellowtail was fine, and the salmon was okay. The cucumber salad was okay, but not as described. The kimchi rolls didn't really taste anything like kimchi, just cabbage-y, and the eel rolls were good, but needed more sauce.\n\nAnd it took the staff a bit of time to greet us when we walked in.\n\nNothing was bad with the exception of the tuna, but nothing was really outstanding either. I won't be back."
2	"The Sushi was fab!!  We had some specialty rolls and Shashimi, both were very melt in your mouth fresh!\n\nService was a bit slow as I think they only had 2 waitresses for the entire place.\n\nCost seemed to be very reasonable.\n\nWould certainly make the drive from South Scottsdale there again!"
2	"Mikado is my favorite sushi place in the Chandler/Gilbert area.  The fish is AMAZING and they often have really great stuff in, like blue fin, etc.  The chefs are really good and often make me special things that aren't on the menu.  The nigiri portions are very generous. \nThis is one of the two or three places where I try the specialty rolls, the albacore and garlic roll is awesome.  Also they have specialty sashimi that you should really try if you go.  Another winner is the tempura and garlic app, the deep fried garlic is actually sweet and mellow, very nice.\nThe atmosphere is nice and the staff is VERY friendly, and the prices are totally reasonable.  Like I said before, my favorite sushi spot anywhere near me."
2	"Great Sushi, a little expensive, but you can't complain for good sushi."
2	"A consistently great place, and one of the few I've found that actually does the deep fried rolls correctly. The staff are excellent and give superb service, and the sushi chefs fun to be around and most skilled in their art. Just wish they stayed open later than 9pm on the weekend, but other than that small quibble I've always been pleased when I've been there."
2	"Amazing, amazing, amazing. I love their cucumber salad, their tempura is delicious without being soggy, the bento combos are adorable and overflowing with food.. and oh yeah, the sushi is AMAZING."
2	"Best sushi ever. I come here often for lunch."
2	"Great service, amazing food, good prices. The inside is pretty small and gets fairly crowded during happy hour, but it remains pretty quiet."
1	"Attempted to check this place out tonight because I heard it was good. I'm on travel for business and my company gave me an American Express card for all my expenses. Well after driving down here and just getting ready to order, I ask to make sure they accept Amex and sure enough they don't. Also they don't accept discover cards either so I left. They didn't seem to care."
2	"I brought my sister here (she's the sushi lover. Me? Not so much.) before she flew back to CA. She was really impressed with the albacore, I tried it and it was delicious - I have never said that about any raw fish. I kept it pedestrian with a df spicy tuna roll and the shitake roll. Skip the shitake (too sweet), spicy tuna wasn't so spicy but it was great. I'd go back during happy hour too, the prices were super low."
2	"I enjoyed this place. It's decent Sushi in AZ and it even appears to be owned and staffed by... wait for it... ACTUAL JAPANESE people. As opposed to 95% of sushi places owned/run by Koreans who memorized \""Hello', \""Thanks\"", and \""Cheers' in Japanese and attempt to trick their customers by pretending to be Japanese.\n\nToo bad this place is so far south it's practically Casa Grande adjacent."
2	"Let's start off with; the service is mediocre but the food is worth it.  If you can get past the fact that once you are seated and have your sushi, any thought of a drink refill should be put right out of your mind.  But like I said, the food is better than RA and Kona so if food quality is on the top of your mind, you must try Mikado.  I lived close to Mikado for 8 years and my son and I went there often over that time.  Now that I don't live close to it, I still go out of my way to go.  It's a nice experience and is pretty low key.  The lightening is even pretty dim, which appeals to the sushi lover who isn't impressed by the bright flourescent lighting in typical resaurants.  It's a bonus that a Japanese couple actual own and operate it.  ;-)"
2	"I was introduced to Mikado's by a good friend and we all went there one night and ordered about 10x what we ended up eating. Not only is the sushi good but the other things such as tempura are also amazing. But I did get a chance to try at least a little bit of each thing and it was great. The service is great they are great at taking care of you and helping you out.\nThe only thing I would say is that it is a bit pricey, it's not someplace that I would go on a regular basis, but every once in a while is nice."
1	"Perhaps it was the busiest day of the year but the service was horrible. 12 minutes before anyone even came to our table and beverages were always empty. \n\nThe sushi was just okay. Feels like due to thanksgiving, shipping fresh fish was backed up. The salmon was mushy and the flavor was light."
2	"So happy to have accidentally found this place! Hamachi X Hamachi roll is so delicious, and I may actually punch a stranger for the Volcano roll... oh cherry blossom roll they are all amazing!! \nI get my food to go from here since I usually go on my lunch break from work. They are all SO friendly welcome me everytime I come in and say goodbye whole heartedly. The woman whom answers the phone knows my name now... obviously I have a sushi problem.. hey it could be worse\n\nI highly advise you to go here"
1	"Service when it came was good.  But folks got lost for a while so it took a bit for someone to actually show up to take our order, which was odd since the place was near empty.\n\nAs for the food, I had relatively low expectations for sushi in Arizona so I was willing to be generous.  Having said that, the food was merely adequate...neither bad, nor good.  But what was really weird was that everything (keep in mind we're talking sushi here) came out warm.  I gotta admit that was a first for sushi I've had anywhere...and that covers a lot of territory around the world."
2	"I've been enjoying this place for quite a while, figured I should finally review :)\n\nThis is not a trendy, upscale, over-the-top sushi place. You will not find the absolute best, most exotic items. But what you will find is reasonably priced Japanese fare that is fresh, tasty and consistent.\n\nI've enjoyed their sashimi offerings - the tuna and the spicy salmon avocado. I've over-indulged on several of their delicious sushi rolls. And my wife is partial to their Tuna Tataki - great sauce! \n\nHas items for my picky, non-sushi eater (fried prawns or the pork tenderloin).\n\nTheir service is always friendly but they get distracted or confused or just lost (can't quite figure it out). And I've not seen any advantage to sitting at the bar as in any other sushi place. So some quirks but good food, good prices."
2	"Love this place.  Food is always great.  Nice warm atmosphere The people working there very friendly. My family tends to go for the combos which allow you to have a 2-4 choices out of  4 columns of items, involving teriyaki, sushi rolls, sashimi, and other items along with soup, rice, and salad. My teen-aged daughter had me take her and 3 of her friends there to celebrate her birthday, because it is her favorite place. They had a great time and the waitress gave one of her friends \""training wheel chopsticks\"" (and a fork) when she wasn't keeping up with the others.   Nice warm atmosphere.  They are a small restaurant that sometimes gets overwhelmed by its own popularity, so we have had slow service while trying to handle a big rush.Customer base seems to vary greatly... I have seen days where it was all familys with lots of kids, and college students some visits,  and on other evening visits saw couples on dates, socializing drinkers at the sushi bar,  and a big group of business people on a business trip.  As I said, it is a great little place."
1	"Wasn't too impressed with their food. We tried a variety of their rolls and nothing stood out. Sakana's still the best!"
2	"Mikado is about 2 minutes away from our house which is the main reason why my boyfriend and I frequent it so much, but the sushi is also fabulous. The fish is very fresh (we are huge fans of the albacore onion sashimi) and the rolls are really good too. We tend to get more rolls than nigiri but both never disappoint. It's not the biggest restaurant inside but we've never had an issue getting a table- we usually sit at the same one :). We have never had bad sushi at this place which is why we keep coming back."
2	"Go here for freshly made sushi - which is also delicious - and for very reasonable prices!\n \nI go here at least once a week when I am not travelling and would recommend to anyone in the Chandler/Ocotillo area."
2	"This place rocks!!"
1	"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Although the food was quite delicious. I ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, edamame and a spicy salmon roll. The total came to 18.00 even. I left 24 dollars on the table. When I left, as I approached my car, the waitress chased after me and stated \""WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SERIVCE?!\""\nPuzzled, I politely responded \""no, why?\""\nAnd this rude ass said \""Because I thought you would have tipped more\""\n\nARE YOU JOKING ME? That is so rude and I almost wanted to tell her to give me my 6 dollars tip back because shoot, I could put that in my gas tank lady. \n\nGood food but not good enough for me to come back. Sayonara."
1	"Awful service! I used to come her back in 2010 when it was new, the food and staff were awsome! I recently came back and the staff is all new. One word... RUDE. Our waitress seemed pestered when id ask for a refill or when id place another order. Like, um, sorry to bother you at work lady? The food was good, but theres a ton of other sushi places in the east valley with the same grade of food and better service. Its a shame this place shot to shi*, could have been a real gem."
2	"Great lunch time or dinner spot especially for the price. Their sushi is pretty good as well as any thing they coat with tempura. Their lunch time 2 item special which comes with soup or salad and rice will only set you back less then 8 bucks. You will not be disappointed."
1	"We a group of 4 were seated at a booth. They brought our drinks and told us they had a party of 8 that walked in an we needed to move to a small table. How rude is that. They just wanted the 18% gratuity at the cost of loosing customers. They did not ask kindly they just wanted us to move. Unreal to be treated this way. I guess we will never go back."
2	"Best sushi in the area! Service and atmosphere are traditional Asian hospitality. Prices are fair, too."
1	"I have never been treated so badly by staff/manager in my life. I ordered a kirin (tasty) 2 rolls and veg tempura. The spicy salmon was AWFUL. It was huge chunks of old salmon with mayo. I tried to politely tell the server i didnt like it when the sushi chef sat and argued with me that he had made it that way for 11 years and no one has complained. Long story short, when I got my bill they had not taken it off even tho I ate ONE PIECE. They said they would not take it off because everyone else likes it and thats too bad. I was appalled. I told them they would either take it off now or I would walk out. They took it off and threw the bill at me. I cannot believe staff can treat ppl this way. I plan on filing a complaint with the BBB. Their sushi case was leaking and the fish did not look good, I suppose a surprise visit from the Dept of Health might shake them up a bit. I will NEVER go back to this hole in the wall again! Terrible experience"
2	"My favorite sushi place!!! Love Angry Cucumber appetizer. We always order the Bluefin Tuna Sashimi. Yummmmm"
2	"Fresh great tasting sushi."
2	"My boyfriend and I came here for a late lunch during happy hour a few weeks ago. We both got the avocado roll and the veggie tempura roll and they were both very tasty. Our only complaint about the whole place was that the tempura roll was way too big to eat in one bite - this seems to be a common theme in Arizona sushi. It just seems so wrong to eat a piece of sushi in more than one bite, but there was no way I'd be able to chew if I'd tried. But it was yummy and I was happy to see that there was more than just one vegetarian roll on the menu.\n\nHappy hour prices (at least for the food, we didn't order drinks) are great. We got four rolls, two miso soups, and green tea and I think the total was under $20. The place wasn't very crowded so the service was fast and the people were friendly. And the decor was nice and simple, though I'm not a huge fan of TVs in restaurants.\n\nI'll definitely be coming back here in the future!"
1	"Always loved this place but then they got a new manager or owner -- the area around the sushi bar turns us off of eating now. Messy bussing stations on both sides, open trash bins, boxes, lots of containers. \n\nSushi is ok but they no longer have new rolls on the board anymore so the menu has been the same for a long time.\n\nJust not a positive expereince any more -- folks who work there are very friendly though.\n\nBummer..."
1	"i'm so sad!  this used to be my favorite place in Chandler.  Like... visit once a week, tell all of my friends, dream about eating here favorite place.\n\nI think success might have gotten to their head but they are no longer the sweet little hole in the wall secret sushi place i knew them once to be with the amazing customer service and great food.\n\ni recently went for happy hour with my mom... let's be honest, their happy hour was never that amazing but it was decent.  enough to make the excuse to come in.\n\nwe order... which takes a while, despite there being only being three other tables.  we were ignored for a while.  not a deal breaker.  i get that you might be busy or new.  everyone seemed to be a new face so i let it slide.  \n\nevery visit, my mom orders the same thing... tuna tataki -- not super spicy. it's her favorite thing on the menu & we've been ordering it for at least two years that way. we were told by three different people that wasn't possible.  tuna tataki is naturally spicy so there isn't any way to make it not so spicy.  they finally cave & tell us they'll do it for us this time... when she gets it, it's still pretty spicy & she can't eat it.  \n\ni ordered scallop nigiri.  the sushi chef asked if i wanted spicy scallop which should have been my first clue... nope.  just regular please.  the thing was drenched in lemon juice but that couldn't hide the intense fishy smell.  i know scallops are hit or miss in arizona but i could always look forward to coming to mikado & getting something fresh... i guess i just trusted them more not to serve that.  i was wrong.\n\ni ordered the albacore onion sashimi also & was completely baffled by the texture of the fish.  it was mushy & fishy tasting... despite the ponzu & onion to cover up the taste.  i couldn't finish it.\n\nwe didn't receive our salads.  waters weren't refilled.  it was the worst experience i've had at mikado & after an intense decline in customer service and food quality, i've decided to retire it from my favorite places in phoenix.  :(  it's sad but i'd rather spend my money elsewhere."
1	"Disappointing atmosphere and disgusting food. Tried this place based on the good reviews. It was a waste of time and money.  The sushi was served almost warm, bordering on tepid, and the texture was very wrong, all chopped up and mushy, (in particular the salmon sushi).\n\nPrices were not good, even taking into account the sub-standard atmosphere.  The food was horrible, worst sushi ever."
2	"I'm in from LA on business. Stopped by as it was close to my hotel. Glad I did! Everything was awesome. I started out with miso and the shrimp tempura. Miso was super hot and shrimp was more fried than tempura; but oh so good. Had some tuna & salmon sushi and a shrimp tempura roll. All great,  but the tuna was a little dry. Service was awesome,  they're right on it. Would have given 5 but for the scalded tongue and tuna. Would definitely come back."
1	"We used to love this place and would come weekly.  My wife is a regular here and has in the past thought very highly of Mikado.\n\nLately the food quality has dropped quite a bit and the service has suffered.  We aren't sure if we will be coming back."
1	"I'm completely baffled on how this got the better review then the  Sushi Room a.k.a. Rock Lobster. We were trying to step out of the box I'm going back in the box. \n\nThe wait staff was very friendly. \n\nThe food was absolutely disgusting. I kind of felt bad because they were nice so we just told them we were full and took it to go. I threw it away in the garbage outside the restaurant and drove to Rock Lobster for takeout. I will not make that mistake again. \n\nThe sushi was so big I couldn't put it in my mouth and it fell apart!  It just tasted terrible plus there was no flavor. I have nothing more to say."
2	"My kids and I love this place!  Service....excellent!  Sushi.....flavorful and fresh!  Great prices on meals and sushi! Spicy tuna is our favorite menu item!"
2	"Very friendly staff, who often accommodates this box holder, because I'm forever forgetting my key.  They also make keys.  Love this place."
1	"The map picture for this one is incorrect.  This location is actually at Alma School and Germann, in the Fry's plaza.  I'll give a place 3 strikes before I say something heavily negative, and this is it for this joint.  One employee, Jim, has ruined it for me.  I don't know if he's just an old school chauvinist, or if he's deeply insecure and mean-spirited, but he's waited on me 3 times.  Every time condescending and rude.  And the last time I was so irritated, I just wanted to get out of there and when I got to the car I realized he didn't give me my change.  It was only a nickel, so no big deal.  I hope he can use that towards a customer service class.  \n\nIf he's not there, it's fine and I like all the services that The UPS Store offers.  I used to travel all over the country for a company who has a corporate account with them and I would always get A+ service no matter where I went.  In the future I will use a different location."
2	"Just dropped off a pre-paid label package.  A young lady was on duty.  Very cheerful.  This was a dead-easy transaction.  Drop off package, get receipt.  Other than having to wait in line (there was one person ahead of me), it was quick and easy."
1	"Their UPS upcharge is the highest I have scene.  They charge almost double the normal UPS rate. Other UPS Stores upcharge is a lot less."
1	"I really can not explain the lack of customer service at this branch. I had a lady banker push me for a checking/savings/credit card pretty hard. Since I have a Mortgage with them the teller got a banker to come to the teller window, which I did not want to deal with. Than after 30 mins of going over documents and her sales spell I agree to sign up and she would call me later today to let me know about the credit card because she was backed up and help another lady. A day turns to a week turns to a month, I go to pay my mortgage again and she trys to sell me on a credit card, I was like,\""Hello, you never called me about the last one you tried to sign me up for\"".\n\nI do not have any other accounts their. I do my banking now with Chase because they have a great Military discount for active and Vets."
1	"See my tip! Subway just sucks. They are cheap and want to charge for extra ingredients! How about putting on a fair amount of ingredients in the first place!"
1	"I prepaid for a 90 minute massage and only received 70 minutes.  I was cheated out of 20 minutes (10 minutes at beginning of massage and 10 minutes at end of massage) by Kim Albrecht.  I do not recommend LaBella Salon & Day Spa at 1055 W. Queen Creek Road, Chandler, AZ 85248.  If you decide to take a chance and make an appointment for a massage take your own watch to make sure you are getting what you paid for."
1	"If I could give zero stars to this place I would!  I will NOT step foot into the LaBella Salon again!  My color was DISASTEROUS!!!  My appointment was with Heather.  OMG!  I sat for over 2 HOURS with color on my hair & when we parted it for a cut, there was a quarter of an inch STILL grey!!!! Ugh!!!  She never offered a smidgen of sympathy!  She immediately applied a darker color & stripped me of all if the blonde I had!  I was in the salon for 4 hours w/out lunch & my head STILL stings!!!  She totally ruined my hair.  The roots still are not covered & when I went elsewhere in tears, she looked carefully at it & found areas that had turned green!  I'm sorry...I don't complain & I always find the best in others.  THIS TIME I CANNOT!  DO NOT GO THERE FOR HAIR!!!!"
1	"Do not go here! I got a decent haircut and then when i went back for a coloring. Staff really unprofessional and will not help eachother. I asked for a red all over color and I got black hair with blonde stripes!! When the girl obviously needed help she got no help from her coworkers and they just shrugged their shoulders when I left. Oh well was their attitude and owner takes no responsibility.  I stopped in another salon after leaving and was told I would need to cut my hair because they melted my hair. The girl just kep putting more color on it to try and FIX it.  Appears other people in the reviews are having same issue. Nice atmosphere but stylest has no clue and of course overcharged also from what they quoted me when I sat in chair."
2	"This is where I go too.  It's pretty nice compared to LA fitness, where I was before.\n\nI've gone through a couple instructors in the cycle classes and they all kick my butt.  They have a good selection of classes, but I wish they had more times, they do get kinda crowded.  The tiny yoga studio was poorly thought out.\n\nI really really really wish there was a pool."
1	"I would find another gym if I were you. It's always crowded so the machines are always full with the free weight section being the worst. The equiptment is old and the place is filthy! No one ever wipes down their station and I've NEVER seen anyone from mountainside do it either. The constantly run out of towels, especially if you get there after 6 and it's not a surprise to have your favorite cardio machine out of order which will remain that way for weeks before it gets fixed. If you like Yoga (no the gentle kind) then the room that they have reserved for it is the size of a bathroom so if you don't get there early you can forget about getting a spot. Spend the extra $10 a month and go to Lifetime instead."
1	"I have been going to the \""gym\"" for a long time. I have been a member at several gyms here in the valley and so I feel I can give an informed opinion. This is one of the worst gyms I have been a member of. \n\nI do not mind the family oriented gym too much, but the issue here is that kids were constantly under foot. I have been to gyms with day care centers before. Usually kids remain in that area. Maybe it was because I worked out in the afternoon, but kids were always running amok. \n\nThe employees also don't seem to care much either. I loved standing at the front desk to ask a question and having to wait for the teens to stop talking about who is dating who before they acknowledge you. Or the time I had an appointment with the training manager for personal training and he forgot about me. He asked me to fill out some forms and then just to hold on for a minute and he would come over. So after 45 mins I got sick of waiting and went to talk to him. He was busy having a personal conversation with another trainer there. I know it was personal because I could hear the discussion. \n\nI will say I did enjoy the group classes. The group instructors were always on time and energetic. \n\nIf you enjoy a gym that is overcrowded, has little children running loose and feeling like an inconvenience; then this is the gym for you."
1	"I'm still a member here, mostly because it's so close.  I've been trying to keep my workout outside, but since it's getting so hot out I've had to head back inside.  \n\nI went in around 11:30am on a Friday, and was bombarded with outside sales going on in the lobby.  You want a scented candle?  How about some jewelry?  Try a new antioxidant drink?  Geez!  It made the entrance crowded and looked unprofessional.  I'm guessing Mountainside gets a cut, otherwise I'm not sure why they would allow this.  \n\nLuckily, the sales people associated with these products don't go overboard in there selling tactics, but still.  It's not something that belongs in the gym (unless you have a separate boutique like the Village - love!!).  \n\nOur prepaid year is almost up, so I'm thinking we'll be going elsewhere and sacrificing the drive."
1	"I have been a member for several years and have utilized Core Concepts training.  Core Concepts is great, they have some good trainers at this location so they get 5 stars.\nWhat sucks is the gym and the management team continue to ignore complaints about shoddy equipment.  So for grins after my work out on 8/16 I checked out all the ellipticals, treadmills, stationary bikes, stair climbers etc..Over 50% were in disrepair, ok whats does that mean? Heart rate monitors not working, torn up grips, broken handles, adjustments that didn not work, busted tv's video/audio.\nFor what members are paying, did I mention they sent a letter 8/17 raising fees?, one should get much more for the $$.\nThey just don't seem to care......think twice before signing up or resigning....."
2	"The Top 3 Reasons that made me quit my two other gyms and join Mountainside:\n\n1. Towel Service - this may seem petty, but ain't nobody got time to carry around a damp towel in their car all day. For early morning exercisers, this is a big step up from most other gyms. Full bath towels and small exercise towels available for every visit. \n\n2. Workout Equipment - a large assortment of free weights, sophisticated machines, kettlebells, foam rollers and the TRX system with racks. You'll find dedicated spin class and yoga rooms, and depending on the location, basketball courts and boxing rings.\n\n3. Locker Rooms - big and clean, with ample room to change clothes, do a dance, or whatever. I really like that they've got both a sauna and a steam room.\n\nShort of paying top dollar for a resort style gym, Mountainside impressed me enough to quit both LA Fitness and Gold's, where I had active simultaneous memberships. I am very pleased with my switch. They even offer a discount if you turn in your previous gym's key-ring pass. Check them out!"
2	"I have now been working out at this gym for about 3 months, and I am very glad I joined.  The biggest indication that it was a good decision: I actually go to the gym regularly!  \n\nI'm a big fan of the cardio machines with the little TVs.  Half an hour on the elliptical goes by in no time when I'm watching HGTV!  I'm learning to like (and to use) the selection of free weights, mats and equipment.  If you're like me and feel a little self conscious working out in the presence of really buff, knowledgeable gym folks, rest assured that there are always people of all skill levels here.  \n\nI haven't gone to any of the classes yet, but I'd like to.  Maybe before work someday?  The pre-work workout isn't so bad when it can be followed by a steam, shower, and maybe a smoothie.  \n\nThe gym stays cool, doesn't smell like sweat, and has friendly staff.  This place just feels better than the cheaper alternatives, so I will gladly pay a bit more for quality!"
2	"Our pool is little.  As in approximately 14 feet by 6 feet, in the perfect shape of a rectangle.  My husband had been paying $70-something a month for a pool service to come to our house, test the water, and maybe add a chemical or two.  \n\nNow, we're looking for ways to cut costs so we headed to Leslie's to see how simple it was to do it ourselves.  Let me tell you, it's simple!  The man we worked with didn't diss pool services, which was nice and respectful, but he did say that taking care of our pool on our own was going to be very easy.  \n\nLeslie's lets you bring in your pool water to be tested, free of charge, once a month.  They will then let you know what chemicals you need to add to balance the water again.  It's that easy!\n\nI'm so happy we decided to save money and rely on Leslie's!"
1	"If you need help with chemicals these guys are great.... However to buy anything else takes a ridiculous amount of time! They should really have a separate checkout for other pool items and a designated checkout for people bringing in their pool water for testing. We have been waiting in line here today for 40 minutes to buy 2 items....."
1	"Worst pool store service EVER! I just went in to buy a part for my pool filter because my pressure gage wasn't reading correctly. I tried locating the part myself and couldn't find it so I went to the front to ask if they had them in the back. Two men were in front of me waiting while the other pool store employee was testing their water. The other man asks for the next guy in line and I stated that I wasn't waiting on a water test and I was next in line. He said \""I asked for the next gentleman\"" the man behind me stated to the man I was next and still doesn't help me find a part. Clearly this man couldn't believe a woman could know a part and thought that I would take too much of his valuable time. I will never give my business to them again!"
1	"Sorry, Bradford.\n\nI declare war on Target.  Yelp War.  I bought a microwave at target last year in, say, October.  Being that it was manufactured in August, I feel like it's a reasonable thing to think that it should be working in May of 2009.  However, this is not so reasonable.  Now, if I were a retailer of the size and ilk of Target (I even own their stock) and someone bought a piece of garbage from me, I'd take it back, exchange it for a new microwave of the same model and value, and then deal with Sharp on my own since my voice would mean something to them.\n\nBut no.  If you haven't a receipt w/in 90 days, it doesn't matter how crappy the merchandise was.  Why don't we just go Wal-Mart and make stuff that will last 91 days so then we can give the big F-You! to all our customers?  It'd be great!\n\n(At Costco, if you buy something that sucks, they take it back, no questions asked.  None.  And I've seen this many times, for things much more valuable than microwaves that don't work.)\n\nSo having this standard of comparison, I know that it is possible to take care of a customer, which means that Target powers that be have decided that it just isn't worth it to stand behind their crap.  Well guess what: you just lost my business, and with that dies a little piece of my heart.  You suck, target.  And now Costco gets your business on top of all of that.  May your stores all close (except Brad's) and may your shares plummet to $1.53 before you ditch your senior management and rally to become the store you may have once been and always had the potential to be.\n\nUntil that day, sorry Bradford.  Target can kiss my ass."
1	"This is the Hamilton Branch of a Chandler Library, and literally right inside Hamilton High School.  I approached with my head down, because I'm scared of high schoolers, but luckily I didn't have to go into the high school to get to the library.  \n\nI'm not sure what it's like during the day, but after school is out it's full of students and some random parents with their young children.  It's a smaller than normal branch, but they have a decent selection of books and dvds.  \n\nIt's definitely worth it to drive a couple miles north to the big location in downtown Chandler!"
1	"Normally I have a strict policy against leaving the house on Saturdays due to all the people out running their errands and running over whoever gets in their way, but this morning, Captain Douchebag next door decides to fire up all his power tools at 7:00 a.m., so I thought, what the heck....I'll go out and knock out the stuff on my list.\n\nI had already had a bad experience at Target.  Grabbed a cart, which happened to come with a dirty diaper!  WTF is wrong with people?  Then I got behind a woman who kept trying 14 different maxed out credit cards and it took me forever in the check out lane.  I am not having a good feeling at this point.  I should have gotten a breakfast burrito and immediately gone home.  But I had one more stop that I really wanted to make.  \n\nI had a book on hold at Hamilton Library that I needed for a class, so I thought I'd swing in there a little after 9 and pick it up.  Now, I am the first to admit when I'm wrong, and at the time I truly thought their Saturday hours were 9-5.  I walk in, find my book, and start using the self-checkout.  Suddenly I hear, \""WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?!?!?!?!?\""    \n\nUh.....this is a library....I'm not sure what else I'd be doing.  \n\n\""WE ARE NOT OPEN!  HOW DID YOU GET IN?!?!?\""  \n\nI pointed to the door that I always come in, and said, \""The door right there.\""\n\nAn older gal who has the same hairdo Priscilla Presley had when she married Elvis, proceeded to totally attempt to make me feel like an idiot.\n\n\""YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT!\""\n\n\""Do you mean I can't take the book I just checked out?\""\n\n\""DID YOU SEE THE SIGN OUT FRONT?  YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE!!  ARE YOU FINISHED?  OUR HOURS ARE 1-5.  YOU NEED TO GO DOWNTOWN!! WELL GO AHEAD!!\""\n\n\""I'm truly sorry if I startled you, but don't you open at 9?\""  \n\n\""THAT IS THE DOWNTOWN LOCATION ONLY!  THERE'S A SIGN OUT FRONT!  WE ARE NOT OPEN!\""\n\nHer diatribe was filled with many sighs and eye rolls.  Oh boy.  Her Monday-Friday job must be with TSA.  \n\nThen I said something that's just as dorky as saying, \""oopsie daisy\"".  I said, \""Jiminy, I didn't mean to upset you.  Sorry.\""\n\nJiminy.  Oh yeah.  Who says that?  I'm a dork.  She caught me off guard.\n\nMaybe it's because in my day job I frequently have to correct people and I do it in a way that's friendly, at times humorous, and educational so they actually learn.  It's not rocket science, but yelling at and berating people doesn't really tend to work very well.  \n\nNormally I find this location slightly frustrating anyway.  I've learned to avoid the peak high school comings and goings, but they put up a one way only sign for the library parking lot, and if you follow the sign, on weekends, it takes you to a locked gate.  Makes no sense.  So, I have to turn around and go against the one way, which everyone else does anyway because the entrance/exit is right on Arizona Ave.\n\nAs I left, I realized I should have asked her, \""Who left the door unlocked?\"""
2	"Paradise Bakery &Cafe at The Falls at Ocotillo is always -- always -- busy. That's usually a sign of greatness in a restraunt. Unfortunately, in Southwest Chandler, it's more a sign of the dearth of quality eating establishments... but I digress. \n\nAt Paradise Bakery, all of the menu items are made fresh daily, and it shows. The service is generally good, although sometimes the staff still seems unprepared for the crowds. My favorite menu item is Irish oatmeal served in an oatmeal-cookie bowl. Try it. It's much better than the overrated croissants and muffins."
2	"In the grips of a wi-fi withdrawl (while visiting my grandparents in Sun Lakes) I drove through every godless stripmall in the area hoping to find a internet cafe.  I was lured into this wi-fi oasis and have setup my headquarters here.  The tea sucks hard but the cookie aren't bad.  It's a big place that gets really busy around lunch.  5 stars for www dots and for not kicking me out yet."
1	"The food is usually good  and most of the staff are friendly.  Had a bad experience with a counter person there once, she was very rude, if you hate your job, you should quit.  But other than that the low-fat raspberry muffins are my fav.  \n\n**Update:  Went there today and had their new summer salad.  Might as well have gone to mcdonalds for a salad, not great.  Service was better this time."
2	"I go here all the time...and the fire roasted tomato soup is the most amazing thing ever....and I hate soup.  Go figure.  Anywho, the funny thing that happened today made me realize just how ignorant some of the help could be.  I asked the girl at the counter what comes on the Chicken Artichoke Panini Sandwich and she looked at me strangely and said \""chicken and artichokes.\""  Ok, duh!  Anything else?  Like cheese, tomato, dressing?  \""Oh, let me ask.\""  So she asks the guy that makes the sandwiches what comes on it and he said, \""um, I have no idea.\""  Are you kidding me?  So the manager finally came over and told me everything that was on the sandwich.  Thank you smart lady. \n\nSo, while the service is not the best...the sandwich was amazing.  And I always love my free cookie...."
1	"Limited choices of breakfast.   And our orders came in cold. They seemed to run out of people to clean the tables.  My friend added that they always run out of coffee.  I mean, it is definitely not place to start your day but a place for emergency."
2	"I have not tried anything else except the Chicken Walnut Salad Sandwich (and side), which to me is worth the price.  Cookie that comes with it is really good too!"
2	"One of my 2nd offices. Never disappointed. Employees happy to help. Incredible food. Free wi-fi :) Free refills. Lots of table choices, Ideal location. It's a winner - go there"
2	"I love to come to this restaurant every time I am in rush for lunch. As usual the service crew is giving their out most courtesy which is an A-. I should say it doesn't diminish. Love a roast beef sandwich and their cranberry turkey sandwich. The cookie? hmmm...irresistible. It's a beautiful DAY :)"
2	"So, I've been going to Pardise since it open, what, 7 yrs ago? They have one of the best managers they've ever had, now. Mason, is the best. He's always there when I come in and is the nicest and most helpful manager I've seen EVER. You can tell he's good as all the employere are nice, smiling  and go out of their way to just be pleasant. It's the best feeling to go in here after a hard day at work, so nice!\n\n4 stars? - that's Panera's fault. As they now own Paradise, no samples anmore. Health dept. my foot, that's just Panera being cheap. \n\nOtherwise, great work, guys - you make it joy to come here!"
2	"Feels just like the other Paradise Bakeries I've been to. Nice, clean, food tastes the same."
1	"Always love a good sandwich and soup, but Paradise Bakery clearly disappoints.  We had the half soup/salad and sandwich.   The French Onion Soup was very average, the  chicken on focaccia was  sub-standard, and was surprised that the focaccia bread was underbaked.  I had the Thai Chicken Salad...which to me was a step up from a McDonalds salad and the Pannini (Cuban) was over done.\n\nI have generally had their muffins and baked goods as a take out and they have always been excellent but there are far better places to spend your money on a soup/salad and sandwich."
1	"Every time I come to this place, I promise myself that I'm not going to waste my money here anymore. But it's just so darn convenient to where I work and it has wi-fi so I can do schoolwork over my lunchbreak. \n\nPros: Wi-fi. Healthy options. Great cookies. Close to my work (but you don't care about that!) \n\nCons: It's way overpriced. When I first moved to AZ I loved this place because the sandwiches were crazy-huge and the salads were overflowing and they had free cookie samples! It could be because I used to visit a different (Central Phoenix) location, but I think that general management has cut portion size by a LOT. My salads don't even come close to filling up the bowl now, much less to overflowing, and you're lucky if your turkey sandwich has as much meat on it as a Subway sandwich. Also, they're constantly messing up my order. And I'm not talking about picky orders, I'm talking about getting mayo when i ask for none, or being charged for a whole sandwich when I ordered a half because they wrote it down wrong (I order the half and half special!) These aren't big deals really but it's annoying when at least half of the time your order isn't right.\n\nI know, I know. I should just stop coming here, right?! But, like I said, it's way too convenient to drive a couple of minutes and get some homework done so I can actually have some free time (what's that?!) in the evenings. \n\nIf I have extra time to drive to the Wildflower at Chandler Mall, believe me, I do."
1	"Wife and i visited this PB last night with some coupons we had for dinner. We arrived there around 7pm. The place had very few people in it which was nice.  We sat down in one of the booths next to another booth that was dirty. The place was dead but none of the employees bothered to come out and clean up the whole time we were there. They had music playing over the speakers and every 4 seconds the music would skip like a broken record. This drove me insane. I got up and went over to the counter and asked the girl cutting meat if they could either fix the music or turn it off. She looked at me like i was crazy or something. One of the other employees came up and i explained to him that the music needed to be fixed or turned off. He said the music has been like that for weeks and it didnt bother him. Well it bothers me and i wont come back there until they fix it. I told him to ask the manager for me to turn the music off or fix it. I sat back down and waited for a manager to come acknowledge us but no one ever came. No one bothered to care. From now on i will be going to the other Paradise Bakery off of Germann street and will never come back to this PB. I am finding a lot of the restaurants close to Sun Lakes area suck!"
2	"The French toast bagel is delicious! Even when I was trying to avoid ordering a pastry or cookie, I decided on this gem instead. It satisfied my sweet tooth! I like to sit here and get some work done after a snack. I did bring my boyfriend a steak panini and he didn't like it. Not sure what he disliked about it, but at least it came with a cookie!"
1	"This is not specific to this location.  I am finding all Paradise locations are 2-star.  They aren't BAD, but they aren't really great either.  The staff here was friendly enough, and was even calling some customers by name (I assumed they were regulars).  \n\nOn this occasion we got bagels, scones and cookies for a meeting.\n\nOK...the scones were really good.  I gotta give them credit.  They were very popular at the meeting.  If it was just the scones they'd probably get four stars.\n\nThe bagels were \""just bagels\"", and they didn't offer us any cream cheese (we made the mistake of assuming it was included, so didn't think to ask for any).  The ones at Einstein Brothers are better, and they include the cream cheese (though you do pay a little more for their \""baker's dozen\"", if you buy the cream cheese at Paradise it's about the same).  We ended up getting cream cheese at Einstein because the Paradise was too far away when we realized the error.  They should have asked if we wanted any at Paradise when we were buying the bagels.  Maybe 2.5 stars for the bagels, but deduct a star for neglecting to mention cream cheese.\n\nThe cookies taste manufactured.  That's the only way I can express it.  Not like fresh homemade cookies.  Like a machine's interpretation of what a cookie should be.  I am not impressed.  And this isn't the first time.  I think I am done with their cookies.  One star there.\n\nSo, overall, that's an average of 2 and 1/6 stars.  Or just 2."
1	"Stopped in this morning to meet some folks for coffee and it was closed. The lights were off and the sign was off the front. There was no evidence that a Paradise Bakery had ever been there. Unfortunate."
1	"As another writer mentioned, we too stopped by this morning to find that this location no longer exists, probably as it has become the new Panera being opened at AZ Ave and Ocotillo, which looks to be soon. Just a surprise to one not tuned in!"
1	"The selection of mountain bikes is GIANT and KONA. All the prices on those bikes are full MSRP. The GIANT rental bikes they have at 50$ range are low quality and not very good for riding South Mountain. The chain got tangled up and there was a giant amount of black sludge around it (forgive the pun)\n\nAccessories are all full price and only expensive selections.\n\nPeople working there are helpful but also trying to pull every dime out which makes me believe that they are more concerned about making more money than giving you what you need.\n\nI test rode a few bikes but the process was excruciatingly slow with many people working there but few people paying attention to customers."
1	"I wanted to like Cactus Bikes in ahwatukee and be a frequent customer because I like to support locally owned businesses...but as a consumer I still expect value and decent service.\n\nI've rented a bike there and liked the guys working there - a guy nicknamed \""Fish\"" helped me out and is a good guy. Went back a couple months later to buy some clipless pedals for a bike a purchased elsewhere (almost purchased from them, but found their prices on used rentals way too high and found a better value online).\n\nNew to Mountain Biking I still wanted a local bike shop for service and accessories and was looking for advice and ended up buying a used pair of pedals that they recommended.\n\nGot home, did some reviews on the pedals and found out that not only were they OLD models that are no longer sold, they had HORRIBLE reviews AND I OVERPAID - - THEY CHARGED ME FULL RETAIL for used merchandise!!! I could have gotten much better pedals, new, online or on ebay for half the price.\n\nSo I took them back less than 24 hours for a refund...and then I learned of the consumer dreaded \""RETURNS FOR STORE CREDIT ONLY\"". \n\nIn my opinion, this is just bad business and virtually gauranntees that I won't be back. I can't blame the guys working there...they're just employees and follow orders - not their fault. I do hope the owner reads this and changes their policy...\n\nSo the employees did what they could within the narrow boundaries set by the owner, tried to help but I just wasn't happy, they exchanged them for another pair of used pedals they had in stock. In this economy I like to feel good about the money I spend...and I left Cactus Bikes feeling like they got the best of me."
2	"Justin and staff are very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable."
1	"The real measure of a great business isn't how they treat happy customers, it's how they treat customers who have an issue. The employees of this business are nice, cool and helpful, but sadly they are led by an owner who does not understand how to treat customers. \n\n A group of friends and I flew to PHX for a four-day ride on the Arizona Trail. We were hoping for good local advice and for good rental bikes that were equipped to handle the trail. We got the opposite. We were advised that we did not need slime in our inner tubes, which ended up costing us our first trail day. Collectively we had 12 flats in our first hour on the trail because (as we quickly learned) the AZ trail is full of sharp hazards and slime is absolutely necessary to avoid flats. We had to abandon our first day and catch a ride into Tucson to buy slime tubes. Take my advice, not theirs - if you're riding the AZ trail, buy several slime tubes or your trip will be ruined. \n\nAnother issue is that two of the rental bikes from Cactus had split tire sidewalls. To send a bike out like that is amateur. Unfortunately, by the time we discovered this, we were about two hours from Cactus and ready to embark on the trail, so we booted one tire and changed the other to a brand new tire we had purchased (and which they now have on their rental bike courtesy of us). \n\nAfter the trip, I called the manager about these issues and she immediately got defensive and turned everything back on me. She said it was my fault that we listened to her employee's advice about the slime. And she straight up said I couldn't be telling the truth about the split sidewalls, because her shop would never make a mistake like sending out a bike like that. \n\nI think this shop must not have much nearby competition, or maybe she just doesn't care about my business because I'm from out of town. I got off the phone feeling beat up, and I'm the customer (who spent hundreds in her store). I don't think it's unreasonable to count on a bike shop for good local biking advice, and to count on that bike shop for a rental product that's checked out and ready to ride. But it's not even those issues that are most galling. Everyone makes mistakes - that's just human. But my treatment on the back end was terrible and prompted this review."
2	"Every time I have come here I get very good service.  The people are friendly and do great work.  I brought a bike in for a full tune/clean and they fixed issues that other shops glossed over.  It is a small shop so they don't have a huge selection but for what it is this is a great place."
1	"The service at this location is pitiful. \nNot one person smiled or even acknowledged my existence. I needed to make a return and made it through the entire store with no interaction. Once I made it to the customer service counter the woman was incredibly rude and said maybe two words to me the entire time. \nThe only reason for the 2nd star is for how easy it is to return items at Kohls. \n\nSkip this location!"
2	"Nothing special about this Kohls, just like every other Kohls that I have ever been to. Sure it is a little messy but I don't have high expectations. \n\nGreat for a last minute clothing need, quality is fine for what you pay for the items. Usually can find a pretty good deal on something. Nice selection of snazzy headbands in the Jr. department."
2	"Good dept store. Great selections of products. Weekly sales to make it interesting."
1	"I hate stores that attempt to \""keep you coming back,\"" and such is Kohl's.  Every day there's a sale - potentially better than the sale the day before - not to mention \""Kohl's Cash,\""  and coupons which can be found on their website or in the local paper.  Yeesh!  No piece of mind feeling you got a good deal - and quite honestly, I'm not sure a \""deal\"" can be had, as price tags far exceed value...the reason for continual sales.  Okay enough bashing, you get the picture.  So what's good?  The offering of women's slippers at Christmas time.  Fun, funky and you guessed it.  On sale!"
1	"I agree with dam near every review for this place. Employees look miserable, and by selling over priced items made by b list celebs like \""marc anthony\"", they give the illusion of a great sale. There dress shoes are priced around 90, worth about 40, and hit \""sale\"" for 59.99. Its very hit and miss when it comes to sizes, esp. At this location. It seems like theyre answer for everything is online delivery, instead of directing me to a store that has my size by doing a simple stock check. Then again how much can one really expect from a department store as old as jc pennys. \n\nThere only saving grace is the coupon stacking that someone mentioned earlier. Most places restrict a single coupon per purchase, but ive stacked and left paying 25 bucks for a pretty decent pait of work boots. If you dont have coupons, id go somewhere else."
2	"I like Kohl's.  They have very good sales, and when you go with a coupon you can save a lot.  I really appreciate the Kohl's cash.  I've saved a lot when I go there.  I like their selection of jewelery.  I can always find a good deal at Kohls!"
1	"This location is probably the least friendly I've encountered. I walked around the store 3 times looking for a certain department, and during that time, I could not catch the eye or attention of a single employee. I had to go to a register to ask a question and did not get a very friendly or helpful response. If I didn't have a gift card to spend, I wouldn't be returning to Kohl's at all. I definitely don't plan to return to this location."
2	"These guys really know their BBQ stuff.  Great service and product knowledge.  Highly recommend!!"
2	"Had issues with my roller ball on my blackberry.  I took it in to this Sprint and they were able to fix it in just a few minutes!  This is one of the only repair places for Sprint that ACTUALLY repairs the phones...not just box and ship them somewhere else.\n\nWe plan on moving out of Chandler, but I *WILL* make the trip for any of my cell phone needs to this Sprint!"
2	"I came in today to get my husband a new phone, since he's still rockin' the Razor circa 1999 (and pay as you go no less!!).  I did my research and found out he was interested in the Samsung Moment with Google and we could add a data plan on to mine.  Sweeeeeet.\n\nMaybe 30 minutes later I was all set, and the two men working were super friendly and helpful.  You could tell that they do whatever they can to make the customer happy.  Definitely check them out if you're in need of Sprint help!"
2	"By mistake I thought I could get the same service and quality of work from another Sprint store (in the mall) and surprise, surprise I did not and back to see Danny and Sami went....they are fabulous!"
1	"I do not recommend Sprint. We have 3 devices on sprint. They lied to us from the get go. Told us the phone was 100 total. Turns out that was a down payment only. Told us there was no contract, just month to month. Another lie.\n\nThen they said they gave us a tablet free - no that is $15 a month. And the tablet is set to limit data at 1 GB so there is no extra charge, but that function does not work and we got charged $169.25 overage fee. I think a class action suit is in order for everyone who got ripped off with this tablet. Anyone else out there have this experience? Sprint refused to remove the charge so we are dumping them and going elsewhere.\n\nAlso they promised 4 G in a month. It is still 3G many months later. Sprint drops calls all the time and has bad reception."
1	"Tiny little narrow shop. I had my girls with me.....sign on the front door saying \""please hold children's hands\"".  Code for \""we don't like kids\"".  We circled the store then left. Nothing that I couldn't live without so we left. So I guess this review is based solely on atmosphere."
1	"Low-end \""sports bar\"".\n\nI did not see anything that would attract me there. It has been around for a long time so some people must like it. When I was there it was mostly guys getting off work wanting a beer... nothing fancy, not horrible, but not a place I'd stop at again."
1	"I've been here about three times and did not like it. We were a group of five and it took them forever to pay attention to us.  The waitress didn't really seem to care.  Some customers were rude too as a couple of them made a nasty remark as we were leaving. This happened in '08 haven't been back since, I'm still very angered by this incident."
1	"I went to watch the world cup final. Cheap drinks, a lot of TV's (several Big screen, and each both has it's own Screen as well). Service was ok (considering the place was full), but the food was terrible."
2	"My favorite wings in the East Valley so far."
1	"If you like dudes, this is your Mecca!"
1	"Kinda disappointed on our last visit to Sidelines on 11/10. There were 3 of us total, and we sat outside. We wanted to have the heater on beside us, but it wasn't working so our waitress said she'd send someone out to look at it. Nobody ever came out... The service was REALLY bad and when our food came out it was like it had been sitting there, done, for too long as it was only lukewarm. The food still continues to be great though, flavor wise, which is why we always go back. I just wish they would get some more servers in or something."
1	"I see other people calling this a dive bar, to which I disagree with. To me a dive bar is a place to go and drink for cheap and there is very little else to do than drink (maybe pool, an old juke box, or shuffleboard).\n\nTo me, Sidelines is a sports bar... hence the sports reference in it's name.\n\nI'll be honest, I really don't like Sidelines. Every time I walk in I feel like I'm not wanted. I've gone when it's busy, when it's dead, alone, with a group, when an event is on, and when nothing is going on. I feel like the staff just doesn't really care if I am there. I feel like I am in Scottsdale where if I am not belching and acting like a total jackass, I will get no service. \n\nThe food has never wow'd me. Not at all. Ever.\n\nSure the screens are nice to watch some events on... but I'd much rather got to Zipps or tilted Kilt to watch."
2	"Yet again another place I go to for beverages, usually after work and a long rough day. Super friendly staff, they always have the games on I want to watch. \nProbably my favorite sports bar around my house... I havent eaten anything here, but next time I'm gonna give the wings a whirl."
1	"We went to Sidelines on Friday, Sept. 28, 2012. We  had a coupon from entertainment.com and showed to to our waitress. She said the coupon was valid and we could use it for what we ordered. We ordered fish & chips and a fish sandwich meal which was mediocre at best. After we ate and received the bill the waitress told us due to the computer not accepting our coupon we had to pay full price on the bill. It would have been nice to know this beforehand. The excuse about the computer was a pretty lame excuse. Definitely would not recommend."
2	"The \""Hot\"" wings have a delicious & spicy flavor. The burgers are awesome (I recommend adding green chile to the cheeseburger). But I highly recommend the California Dreamin grilled Chicken sandwich with grilled bacon and fresh avocado, fantastic!"
1	"The food is usually pretty good.\n\nSuper unhappy with the wait times.... ordering, drink refills,  getting the check. \n\nVery unhappy with the fact that i went to eat there with my two girls on a thursday night, my wife ordered an entree, my kids two kids meals, and  i ordered a dozen wings, basket of fries, and a drink. (came out to like 13 or 14 dollars.) And the waitress only gave us one kids meal free.\n\nAsked her about it and she said its only valid per adult entree. I dont get it, so if i would have ordered an 8 dollar hamburger and a water, i could have got the second kids meal free. \n\nFirst of all. You see we have two kids on a thursday night, if my meal isnt going to count as an entree. FLIPPIN TELL ME!!!!  UGGGHHHH, \n\nI guess ill just have to go back to Native New Yorker."
1	"I've been here three times. Fist two times sat at the bar, had a few drinks and enjoyed my time. Bar tenders were friendly, and accommodated everything we could ask for. \n\nMy friend told me about a wing day here so we decided to go. An now why the low rating:\n\nWaitress sucked! We gave our order. Before food came out she gave us a bill that didn't belong to us. We needed to waive her down from standing around to get refills. When the food came out(wings) she got my entire order wrong (because she didn't write it down). The fixed the order...but by time I got my order my friend had finished their meal already. Wings were good, not great. We waited for appx 40 minutes after done eating for bill to see that out amazingly intelligent waitress also tried to overcharge us. Horrible waitress. \n\nIf you go: sit at bar."
1	"Came to Phoenix area to get away from the brutal Chicago winter. To my dismay this joint did not have the NHL package on Direct TV. Really? There are only like a ton of snowbirds down here from the northern U.S. and Canada. We split and are bound for BWW. Who knows about the food?"
1	"Zero stars would be more appropriate. Came in for burger and wings, was one of two tables of customers. Food was terrible, took 45 minutes to get out, the people that ordered after us were served 15 minutes before us. When I paid the check the waitress ran around for 40 minutes with my credit card. Every time i pass this place i wonder how the doors stay open."
1	"Came in for the first time to watch Thursday night football and have a meal. Dirty tables, disorganized and undertrained staff, and only a few tvs had the game on. \n\nOf course no one could hear the game because we had to have 70s rock on instead. \n\nThe food was disappointing. Service was clunky. \n\nHad to ask for waitress to close the door to the smoking patio because a fog of smoke was flowing in.\n\nOnce, and done"
1	"Pathetic !!!  dirty, poor management, terrible food..... needs to close .. dont waste your time or money......"
1	"Terrible food, slow service with attitude. Don't waste time or money on this place. Ordered two appetizers, both disgusting. The smell and taste of old grease was awful. Ordered a coke and beer. The coke was just soda water. Told the waitress and she said, \"" I know, we are busy.\""  How about serve us water and say the coke needs to be changed. I guess they are use to serving SLOP."
1	"As a parent, if you're looking for a place to be coddled, where e-mails are responded to and phone calls are answered by a live person, this is not the place for you.  The management appears nonexistent.  Phone calls are either sent straight to voicemail and not returned, or answered by a receptionist, Kathy, who does not have substantive answers, and forwards your call to someone else's voicemail.  If you want your child to be sent here due to location/price etc., keep on calling the school until you get a hold of someone, or better yet, show up in person.\n\nThe teachers may be more responsive, but if management treats the parents this way, it makes me wonder how it treats its staff."
2	"We love going to school at Risen Savior. The teachers are loving and encouraging, and the small classes ensure that the kids are getting the attention that they need. It's like a second family there."
1	"I don't know why I went down here to old people land.  Oh, I know, because it's the same distance to another Basha's, and I know this one is generally less busy.\n\nI grabbed my 10 items or less and headed to the front.  It was very early and there was only one register open.  As I paid I got $40 cash back and you would have thought I personally took it out of the cashier's pocket.  She huffed and puffed and grumbled about how the last guy gave her a hundred and she's cleaned out again....\n\nSounds to me like you NEED to get cleaned out, but that's beside the point.\n\nI smiled and said, \""Sorry to put you out.\""  She crossed her arms and pouted.  I'm thinkin', isn't that why they pay someone $1.00/hour more than her, to be called a front end manager and go get more change?  Hmmm.  Kinda feel sorry for her the more that I think about it.  The front end manager probably doesn't like her either."
2	"When it comes to quality, affordable asian cuisine...you should always think of 2 words...Asian Grill! This family owned restraunt has amazing service! Ivy the daughter is the best! She knows what it means to provide outstanding customer service and will even remember your name when you return. \n\nTheir impressive lunch special Monday- Saturdays from 11-3, where you get an entree, egg roll, fried rice, wonton and choice of either egg drop or hot and sour soup all for around $5.50~!! It will leave you quite satisfied and full!\n\nNo MSG! And they only use white meat chicken!\n\nTheir hot n sour soup is phenomenal! A small is plentiful, a large is enough to share with at least 3 people! \n\nThe entree portions are HUGE and are carefully prepared to your liking!! They will even customize it for you. Enough to take home for leftovers.\n\nTake the time to enjoy some of the best Asian food out in the Chandler/SunLakes area..they even deliver!  Tell them Bob sent you!"
2	"After reading all the other existing reviews for Asian Grill, I think I have a legit sense of understanding towards why this place gets 1-5 reviews (and everything in between). \n\nTrust me when I say that Asian Grill is a great place for lunch on a weekday. Its not good for large groups, or bday parties, or dinner, or date nights or any of that crap. Its excellent for going outside the office for lunch, eating a good meal and then continuing with your work for the remaining of the day. Its not meant to be a dining experience; its meant to be a dining convenience. \n\nAnd let me explain why: You come in, the menu is already at the counter, you select your combo (soup, lunch plate and a beverage for about $5.45) and pay up front. You fix your own drink, you find a seat, blink, and your plates come up pretty immediately after. \nUnless you have super-powers at eating, you box up whatever you didn't finish and peace out - all in about 20mins or so (total in-out). \n\nWith this (hopefully new) perspective, let me justify my 4 stars for Asian Grill. Simply put: the food is plentiful and although a little greasy, great in flavor and quality. The staff is very friendly, the food comes out SUPER fast and the prices are extremely do-able for what you get. My beef dish was very tasty and the wanton soup was hot and flavorful. I won't go into an over-elaborate description of the food look and feel, because y'all know how standard american/Chinese food tastes like: better than Panda Express, worse than legit Chinese food. Done."
2	"Family-owned, friendly, fast and great for takeout or delivery. We order-in from Asian Grill at least once a month, if not more, but have never actually dined at the restaurant, though the tables are often crowded, so our reliance on this great Chandler/Sun Lakes fave for takeout shouldn't stop you from dining in.\n\nThe very first time I walked in the restaurant to pick up a menu, a woman waiting in line for her pickup order went out of her way to tell me, \""You have to try the hot-and-sour soup; it's the best ever!\"" That's pretty high praise, as I've eaten in Chinatown in both LA and New York. Turns out, her recommendation was spot-on, which explains why Asian Grill is selling it's amazing soup all year around... even in Arizona during the summer.\n\nOur typical order includes the soup or the equally impressive tempura shrimp apetizer, which are huge (and soooo tasty), the cashew chicken dinner, and the House Special Lo Mein, which includes beef, shrimp and vegetables with wonderful noodles.\n\nWe live close, so we often pick up, but their delivery service is free and quick, too. Can't recommend them enough."
1	"Went here this past weekend while visiting sun lakes.  Worst idea we had all trip.   The family that owns and runs it must work hard because they were all there and the place was busy.  The food is just not good.  We got Coconut Shrimp, Orange Chicken, Pork Fried Rice, and egg rolls.\n\nOrange chicken is soggy and pork fried rice was gamy...  The pork was super overcooked and gross.  My brother and I both had half of a plate and called it good...  We were rummaging the cabinets an hour later but neither of us could stomach the idea of more of this gross food."
2	"We've ordered several items from here and everything we've tried has been good.  We live a little outside of their delivery area, but they've accommodated us and yay! Delivery!  The food arrives within 45 minutes or So and is still hot."
2	"Holy crap! This place is awesome! I was at work and decided to place an order for take-out.... Which is really convenient since it is about a 5 minute drive up the road. I am all about garlic chicken, and decided to order their lunch special. Only $5.75 for a whole lot of food! I went in to pick up my order and was greeted with a warm smile... It was as if they already knew who I was. My order was ready immediately... And it was delicious!! This place gets 5 stars for their amazing service and for the food! I will be back soon :)"
2	"My wife and I love this Chinese place. It's not to oily and the food is always delicious. The delivery is very fast as well. Great for a night you don't want to cook or go out!"
1	"I am removing my good rating. The kind of service I received this last time was OUTRAGEOUS!! \n\nWe decided to order delivery this time. Locating a complete menu online was a HUGE pain. We knew they had combo plates though and knew that's what we wanted. My husband searched for at least thirty minutes for a menu listing the combos. \n\nWhen I was finally ready to call I couldn't understand what the lady said at first. So I responded that I wanted to place an order for delivery. She asked me what I wanted. I told her a number one and a number eighteen. The lady asked me \""what?\"" so I repeated. Then she, clear as day, asked \""what is that?\"" I responded the number one, it's the chicken and broccoli combo. Then the number eighteen the spicy honey shrimp. Then she asked me my cross streets, THREE TIMES! The third time I even asked her if she was listening that I had already told her twice. After that we discussed phone numbers and addresses. Then she asks if I want to pay by cash or card. I said card so she asked me for the card number. Worried she might have messed up the order I ask to know the total first. She told me it was $21. The number 1 is about $8 and the 18 about $10 so I thought that seemed right with taxes. I said ok and prepared to give her the card info and she hung up on me. \n\nI was angry by that point. She refused to listen the whole time and then hung up. So my husband called back and told them we needed to pay. She argued that I said I wanted to pay cash. He said \""no she said card.\"" THREE times she repeated him saying \""oh you want to pay cash\"" and he had to yell to stop her from hanging up again before he could get her to understand we were paying by card. \n\nONE HOUR later the food shows up and it's WRONG. Not combos at all but just the two meat dishes. So I called back AGAIN. I told her we ordered combos and they weren't  combos. She told me she repeated the order to me twice and I confirmed. She did not repeat the order even once! She proceeded to call me a liar and hung up!!\n\nSo I took the food back to their shop. I told her I wanted my money back. She said why, I  told her it was because it was wrong and she has poor customer service. She then called me a liar and told me how I was trouble, to get out and never come back. I told her I wasn't going anywhere until I had my money back. She then told me she already voided it. Who's the liar now? She didn't want to give me a refund when I walked in. The delivery guy was visibly shocked when he heard her refuse to refund me. Then she says she already did it? BS. I told her I didn't believe her and I wanted proof. I argued in full view of all the customers for over fifteen minutes. She told me I was a liar over twenty times. Then it turns out she's not even the lady I was talking to on the phone! All of a sudden it slips out someone else does the phone. She's not even really 100% sure what was said! This was the business owner! And the business owner was the lady I talked to when I called about our missing food! The business owner lied about repeating the order to me twice on the phone. And the business owner is the one who called me a liar and hung up on me. She told me she's never had a problem in ten years and I was trouble and a liar over and over. Finally she printed me a receipt saying she had voided our transaction. As I walked out the door she was SCREAMING \""You are a liar! Don't come back!\""\n\nThis lady is insane!! She has an elderly Asian woman answering the phones instead of someone more fluent in English. But if there is a mistake it's all the customer's fault. This only happened tonight so I will have to wait and see if we really are reimbursed for our food!! If we aren't I will be reporting then to the BBB."
1	"Their food has been ok for delivery, and we love our delivery. But even that won't cover bad costumer service!!  Tonight was the last straw, and it was a pick up order.   If their food was great, I would suck it up, but it is no where near great to deal with rude. Better off sticking with Pei Wei."
1	"HORRIBLE! If you like food, do not come here. We tried, tried & tried this place for years but NO GOOD each time. When I see the 4 star review, I know I have to do something.\n\nThe last straw for us is, they would not honor their own coupon that has no expiration date printed.\n\nYakie!"
1	"After ordering one general tsaos chicken and a side of crab puffs for delivery 2 hours passed and my food still never came. I called several times and got different stories on the whereabouts of the driver. First they said he will be leaving soon then immediately after that said the driver left 8mins ago. Finally I decided to cancel my order and have my money refunded back on to my card they assured me it would be done my 9pm. Another 2hrs passed and 9pm rolls around still no refund on my card and now they are not answering my calls, Im assuming they are closed for the evening. The next morning I proceeded to try and follow up again about my money still no answer still no refund. Very poor customer service and accountability. Never got a chance to try their food and from my first impression I will not consider it."
2	"We ordered online which was convenient,  but were disappointed that it took over an hour for the order to arrive.  The food was delivered warm and tasty. We especially enjoyed the lemon chicken and vegetable egg roll."
2	"Great prices for happy hour. Service is always stellar. Definitely ask to sit outside. Try the firecracker shrimp!"
1	"Atmosphere is typical of other chain restaurants...nice and clean but nothing special. Food was so so. Our party ordered the \""spicy\"" chicken wings as an appetizer but no one tasted anything remotely close to \""spicy\"". I had the fish and chips...the batter was good and the fish moist, well prepared. Service was a bit slow, considering they were not busy at all when we were there."
1	"Hadn't been here in about a year. Now I remember why. Food is nothing special. They used to have really good carne asada tacos and pork medallions on menu over a year ago. Have tried a few menu items since then and always a bit disappointing.  I like the ambience and the staff are always friendly.  Won't be back anytime soon because the food is not that good,  unfortunately.  They need new food items on the menu."
1	"Looked like a very nice place to eat so we thought we would check it out one night. All was fine until we got our food. I ordered filet mignon well done because that's how I always like my steak and a friend ordered a steak as well only medium well. Well we both got our steaks and they were very rare and blood was pouring out when we cut into them. Disgusting! I sent mine back and when it came back out to me it was charred so bad I couldn't eat the outside of it. They need to get a better chef!"
2	"I had a great lunch for $7 plus tax & tip that wasn't really heavy and tasted great. The sevice was friendly; the place looks great inside kind of feels like a restaurant sports grill mix.  They didn't have a lot of TV's in the dinning room so I guess you can only watch games in bar area which was limited on space."
1	"This review is a little outdated but I'm playing catch-up and wanted to include this.\n\nWe've passed this place a bunch and decided to go try it out for dinner one night.  I ordered a balsamic vinegar salmon and when it was delivered I could smell it was off (and the chef didn't?).  I tried a small bite to be sure, and yup, it was off.  I told the waiter and, get this, he tried to tell me that can happen when you put balsamic vinegar on fish.  Seriously? First off, no, it doesn't.  Secondly, if it did, why would you offer it? Third, WHO CARES!?!?!? It's bad.  Say you're sorry, take it back, offer something up, whatever.  Then it took the manager to come over and I had to explain that the fish was bad and they tried to offer me something else.  Let's see, I just had a plate of bad fish delivered to me and the smell is still in my nostrils. Yeah, ya know what, can I have some chicken?  Rare if you don't mind, so we can keep with the theme.  Knotheads.  \n\nI have to assume it was just a bad experience for me, as they are still there, and I see some good reviews, but I won't ever go there again."
2	"Great food and service, reasonably priced. Try the veggie sandwich !"
2	"Well at Keegan's you get a mixed bag. If all the stars align this place is great for a quick dinner out. However it can go bad quickly. I have been here many many times and over all if you come on off hours the happy hour is great and so is the food. When they are busy all hell breaks loose. Food take forever, service almost comes to a halt and it just seems to come unglued. I will say give  it a try just hope it's not one of those nights  LOL."
2	"This place has stood the test of time. I've been coming for years. I wouldn't say I am a regular, mostly because the service is mediocre. So you never really know how your visit will turn out. The food is good. I can say they don't seem to change up the menu really. But they do offer daily specials and have a great decor inside. There is ample seating, it's always clean and cozy. The outside fire pit on the patio is one of my favorite spots in the cold months. They serve Guinness and Jameson so until that stops, they are one of my \""go-to\"" spots for dinner!"
2	"Food and service was good, they paid good attention to us..."
1	"The service has been awful  since this place opened.  Have not been in a really long time.  Just stopped for a beer.  The bar tender did not even say hi when I came in.  Let me sit for awhile,  cleared some spots from people that left and then looked at me and waited on new people that just walked in the door!  Ugh..  It's like the Charlie Brown, Lucy and the football.  Nothing changes.  I left."
1	"Been here twice. \n\nTerrible food and terrible service."
1	"Ate here recently with a large group.  While we appreciated that they had the capacity to serve our group, the service could have been better.  My sandwich was incorrectly placed on someone else's plate, and the server just put it on a different plate, added the salad and gave it to me.  The other  person in our group had already touched it, so I wasn't thrilled that it was given to me at that point.  While the sandwich tasted fine, I had a hard time getting past that.  In the end, I placed cash in the presenter and waited for some time for my change, which never came.  Because we were in a hurry, I didn't bother waiting around.  Probably won't return."
2	"Not sure about anything other than Dee is the most personable and attentive server/bartender on earth. Service here is awesome and the Tai Cobb Salad is off the charts. I can't speak for anything other than that as I believe I've order it about 75 times and something else about twice. If you like salmon and salad, go here and get the above-mentioned salad during lunch. Your afternoon will be better for it!"
1	"We had one horrible experience which was bad enough that I will not be returning. We went to lunch for a friends birthday. It wasn't busy when we went in & it took a while to get a waitress to take our order. We decided on the two salmon salads & both were horrible. For the amount of time it took to get the food, we were expecting something really tasty! ... No such luck. The salmon tasted weird & was way overcooked ... Completely charred.\n\nWe talked to the manager as a result of our bad meals & were offered a complementary dessert to make up for it. Knowing how long it took to place our order, to get our order, & the quality of the food, we should've known better. We thought we would give them a chance & get the Heathbar Mud Pie. At this point, we literally thought we were being punk'd. The ice-cream was really icy, the crunchy things were rock hard, etc. Don't even get me started on the amount of time it took us to get the check .. Thankfully, we just left cash to cover the bill & left! We were not pleased at all."
