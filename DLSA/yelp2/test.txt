1	"Went in to get a dress for my young daughter. Was ignored from start to finish. When I asked if they could see if another store had the dress I wanted, instead of offering to call, they offered to give me the number so I could call. Terrible customer service. I bought my wedding dress here 10 years ago. Will never go back."
1	"Afer my final alerations appointment yesterday...this place gets 1 star. \n\nWaited 15 mins before being helped when I had appointment at 6. \n\nWas told at previous appointment by one of the alterations ladies to leave my veil and slip with the dress and the slip was lost and somehow I was being blamed for this. \n\nThe alterations lady helping me was extremely rude to my wedding planner! No excuse me or please just \""move!\""and \""Get out of the way!\"" I know right?! Rude!  \n\nI was also rushed out of my dress so she could stitch something because \""I need to go home\"". Who says that to a customer?! \n\nI waa given a new slip and apologized to by two managers and even though my first two appointments were worth 5 stars this one experience is enough to make me never go back or recommend anyone here."
1	"I was told that they didnt carry my size in the dress I had picked out for my wedding at any David's Bridal in Arizona. She even made a point to say the only one they had in a store ANYWHERE in my size was in New York and that I would have to order it asap from the warehouse for it to be here in time for my wedding . Also since I had to order it I had to pay everything up front and couldn't use the layaway. I happened to be at the paradise valley location today looking for bridesmaid dresses and guess what? Found my dress in my size! So this way I could buy it off the rack and use layaway, I put a down payment and will be using that location from now on. The people at the phoenix location seem super shady. They all work for commission so they'll say whatever they have to so that you will buy your dress from them! If they tell you they dont have your size/color or whatever at any other store, definitely dont just take their word for it."
1	"what an awful experience.\n\nwe're getting married (yay!) in October and have started the search for my wedding dress. my mom and friends flew in from out of town and i also had a few close friends from phoenix come out for a day of fun, trying on dresses, and girl stuff. the plan was to have an awesome day and hopefully find the dream dress.\n\nwe had all just come from a wonderful experience at uptown bridal in downtown chandler (girls, i highly recommend hitting this place up!). now, i knew that david's bridal was more of a national chain and that it was a busy place, full of dresses and people and that i probably wasn't going to get the personalized attention that i had gotten at the previous salon. fully understood this. but i wasn't prepared for the complete lack of caring by the david's bridal associate, the cramped dressing room, and the little to no help of getting into the gowns that were being pushed on me by the associate. it sucked.\n\nthe location itself is fine, however, the store inside is dirty and the dressing rooms/carpets are kind of gross. not a huge fan. the dressing rooms are also extremely small. its hard to be in there with three other dresses and attempting to get into a fourth. its a small miracle i didn't fall out of the room half naked while stuck in some fluffy gown from hell. the associate started off ok but i could tell it had been a busy day for her. i didn't want to be an annoyance so i asked her to pull up my favorites from the david's bridal website and go from there. she immediately crossed half of the dresses because they weren't available at that store (thanks for telling me in advance) and then went off to collect the remaining dresses. we waited for another 15 minutes before she came back with two dresses.... one of which was not on my favorites. \n\nat uptown bridal i had been given a slip which covered my body and definitely helped with the shyness factor. here at db she threw a corset at me and told me to get into the dresses and then open the door so she could zip me up. what the hell? most of these dresses weigh a ton and have so much tulle in the bottom you get lost! it was really hard getting into these things, but also given the size of the dressing room, i'm not sure how she would have helped all that much without having to have the door open. \n\ni tried on dress after dress that she brought which were not on my favorites :/. my friend had to step in and insist that she actually bring some from the list. also the associate disappeared for lengthy periods of time leaving me waiting in the dressing room helpless. i finally had my other friend come in and help me otherwise we would have been there for hours. the associate kept trying to push dresses on me that were not at all aligned with what i had told her my style/preference was. it just became a depressing, hot, and really draining effort to be at this location with an associate that really didnt care at all.\n\ni will never ever recommend going to this david's bridal location to anyone. it was awful and i cannot see spending my money at this particular store."
1	"This past weekend my sister, future sister-in-law, and future mother-in-law flew into town just to come with me to look for a wedding dress. Our first appointment was a David's Bridal and I was excited to have everyone there with me and I have only been to this store in the past to get a bridesmaid gown. \n\nWell needless to say our time spent there was awful...\n\nFirst, the place is really gross. The carpet is so dirty. There is one spot on the bridal stage that looks like someone spilled something and dirt has just been tracked all over it instead of it being cleaned. The dresses you try on are really dirty too. Which I understand because hundreds of ladies are trying on these dresses week to week but it was really hard to get excited when there were stains all over these beautiful dresses!\n\nThen, our customer service was TERRIBLE. Her name was Deborah and to start, she reeked of cigarette smoke. The last thing I want is to be in this tiny room trying to try on dresses and smell that... And she was really rude in the process. I had 6 women with me who were being very polite and helpful and she was huffing and puffing, rolling her eyes, and was even talking crap about us to another employee there. She in no way seemed like she was happy to help us at all. Thankfully her assistant was nice and made the experience worth staying for. \n\nIn the end I did NOT find my dress at David's Bridal and I'm glad I didn't. My girls will be getting their dresses from there but only because of the color. \n\nI got my dress in Gilbert at Suzanne's Bridal Boutique and they are AMAZING over there. I would highly recommend them to anyone!\n\n**UPDATE** (4/18/2014)\nJust so all of the yelp users know... I was HORRIBLE harassed by someone through yelp messages about my bad review on David's Bridal. They claimed to have been another bride looking for dresses on the same day as me. They said my family was awful, ruined her experience, that she posted a video of how bad my family was, and everyone clapped when we left. I told her she had the wrong person and asked her what day she was there. It took her a while to tell me the date and when she finally did she had the totally wrong one! When I told her she had the wrong date she responded with \""Oh ya, it was that day!\"" Ummm hello? How do you not remember the day you found your wedding dress! And I was there on a Saturday and she claimed it was a Monday... BIG difference considering I was at work on Monday. She has yet to give me the link to this \""video\"" she claims to have... \n\nNeedless to say I think it is someone from David's Bridal who is just upset that I didn't have anything nice to say about their store because this \""user\"" just set up an account this month.\n\nIf it is someone from that store I hope the manager reads this posts and realizes that she needs to makes some changes with her staff!"
1	"Came in to try on dresses for my daughters wedding. Had an appointment and the girl didn't even attend to me!! Poor customer service... And to think the Tucson location was 10x's better in helping out oh and the place was very dusty ... Very disappointed"
1	"Awful experience was in Arizona for my daughters basketball tournament and between games we were on a mad dash to find a dress. Greeted at the door and after that we were on our own. I guess they don't like to help girls in basketball clothes and obviously just played.in a game .Asked a sales associate if 3 dresses were on the 50 %off rack and she assured us they were. traveling for sports we have to have a budget in place. My daughter decided on a beautiful dress to find out the dress WASNOT on sale . The  associate that was ringing us out was the associate that.told us they were on sale . After walking without purchasing the dress.With  my daughter completely broken hearted to return into the store to talk to the other manager Lindsay let her know how I felt and the store basically used he bait and switch on us. Lindsay being a manger didn't do a thing but stand there telling me the customer service rep was out till Tuesday? Really if I were at Macys I would have received the price I was quoted. I purchased the dress only because my daughter had prom I less than a week away and my daughter paid the other half as if it were 50 off . have 3 girls and will NEVER step foot in another Davids Bridal ."
1	"My sister, mother and I drove 45 minutes to the nearest Davids Bridal to get our measurements for my other sister ( who lives in Vegas)'s wedding. We arrived on a Saturday morning with no appointment, so we assumed there would be a wait and we would need to be patient. The lady at the front took our name and said that we could browse around until someone called us or found us. \n\nAs we were looking around, we were searching for a dress for my mom to wear at the wedding. The staff was weaving in and out of us without even saying \""excuse me\"" or \""I'm sorry\"". When we found a dress that my mom liked that was on the sale rack, we asked if there was any way that we could order the dress in the size that we needed or call another store to purchase it from there and two staff members said \""no, we are not allowed to do that due to the dress being on sale\"". So we just decided to wait around and about 20 minutes later, we were called to be measured. \n\nThis lady who helped us was the most rude person I have ever met. I did not get a great look at her name tag because she was barely ever with us, but it was something along the lines of Aona, etc. When she found us, all she said was \""who are you?\"" when we told her were bridesmaids wanting to get measured, she said it was required to put the dress back on to be measured, no big deal. She gives me a head to toe look down (which I did not appreciate) and stated \""you're a size 14 or 16\"". This was appalling to me. I am proudly a size 10 (in a David's Bridal dress) and did not think it was very professional for her to look me up and down and tell me what size I was. We had previously gone to the Vegas David's Bridal to pick out the bridesmaids dresses and the staff there asked me what size jeans I wear and explained that they would add a size or 2 up to find a good fit. She also gave my sister a dress size 8 sizes too small because it was \""required\"" to put the dress on in order to measure us. \n\nSo we put our dresses on and she measures my sister who barely had the dress on because it was so small and looks at me and I tell her that the size 10 is perfect except that a little needed to be taken in right below my armpit about an inch. She looked at me and said \""Just buy a padded bra\"" and I told her that I would never wear a padded bra that would cover a whole inch around me again. So she said \""then just get a strapless bra\"" and I said I was going to but that a strapless bra would not hold my dress up by itself. She proceeds to leave us without taking my measurements at all and left me standing there wondering what she wanted me to do. My sister goes to ask her to take my measurements and she told me to take my dress off and for us to go to the front and someone else will do it. So I did and the lady in front took my measurements without my dress on; BUT WAIT. I thought it was \""required\"" to have the dress on..\n\nWe finally got our measurements taken down and asked the lady to be sure that they were put into the computer so that my sister in Vegas could order our dresses from there a couple hours later because they were just going to be delivered to the Vegas store. We decided to look at shoes for a little bit and then leave. On the way out, we asked the lady at the front desk who were signed in with to check really quick if she could to make sure the measurements were put in. She said \""I'm pretty sure they're in there\"" and she messed around on the computer and looks around and says \""I'll make sure they're in there soon\"". So we leave.\n\nMy sister in Vegas then goes to her David's Bridal to order our dresses with the correct sizes and measurements and the staff there says that there are no measurements on her page. AND they tell us that the dress that my mother wanted to purchase that was on sale and not in her size could have been purchased over the phone at any David's Bridal in the country. We decided to call the Arizona (on Ray Rd) store back and let them know that the measurements were not in and that they lost a purchase and they came up with every excuse as to why the measurements were not in and gave us the most worthless apology for the dress my mother was interested in.\n\nI will never go to this David's Bridal again. I will gladly search elsewhere for another dress that I will need. The staff here are careless and rude."
1	"The shopping experience when I first went in to the Phoenix location to find a dress was great! The woman that helped me was very patient and helpful.  From there it only went downhill though.  I was supposed to have bra cups put into the dress and it was to also include a preservation kit.  The dress came without the bra cups and without the preservation kit.  I had to call TWO more times until I finally got the preservation kit sent to me (which arrived less than a week before my wedding). \n\nI went to a David's Bridal in CT (Danbury) and we waited about 20-30 minutes in the back room without even being acknowledged by a seamstress.  When I finally walked out to get someone, the woman was extremely rude and inpatient.  She wanted to put the WRONG bra size cups on my dress and her solution to me wanting to cover up my cleavage a bit was to put a material on my dress that didn't even match.  We ended up walking out and going somewhere else.  The service was horrible.  Come to find out, my dress was also missing a clasp in the back AND the bustle.   I would NOT recommend David's Bridal for any brides."
1	"This is the 2nd Davids Bridal I visited for my wedding gown - and I hated both visits. I was helped - but my consultant was also helping someone else. I had to wait a while just to get helped into and out of my dress. Not the best experience. There are lots of places to go, to get a dress that not 1000 other people have as well."
1	"Picking out your wedding dress is supposed to be one of the best moments of your life. Mine was far from that. I picked out a dress I did love but I needed alterations, I was getting married in the LDS temple and needed sleeves added. They assured me alterations would be simple, they do them all the time. I mentioned it several times and they kept insisting it was so easy and so simple all I had to do was bring my dress back and they'd take care of it. I bought the dress and when it arrived I took it to get alterations. Then, and only then, was I told it would cost $360 for alterations another $120 to be hemmed and I had to provide my own fabric. Obviously I was upset. My dress alone cost $400, I think it's ridiculous that alterations cost more than the dress itself. They tried to sell me a flower girl dress that matched so I could take the fabric from that for alterations, they offered the idea of a bolero jacket, it was sell sell sell and I found myself standing there, almost in tears, because I no longer wanted the dress I had paid for. It was in that moment that I demanded my money back. I felt deceived and I was not going to pay for a dress I didn't want. They told me all sales were final. Once again I demanded my money back! It was then that the manager happened to remember that they had that same dress with sleeves added already, at the same price as the sleeveless one that I had bought. I traded dresses and ordered the one with sleeves and though I did love my dress, I feel like David's Bridal was completely deceiving and was just trying to choke the money out of me. It wasn't until I demanded a refund that they \""remembered\"" the other dress. I would never recommend them and am so disappointed in how I was treated."
1	"I decided to make this my first stop on my never-ending quest to find the perfect wedding dress.  I thought this would be a good place to start since it would have many different styles in a variety of price points. Unfortunately it was a very disappointing experience. \n\nFirst, when we walked in I got the same feeling I have anytime I go into Sears. The carpet was dirty, the dressing rooms were barren, and it smelled like feet.\n\nSecond, our consultant seemed to be clueless. I gave her a few ideas about what I was looking for (a-line, under $800, illusion neckline or sleeves). She really struggled finding anything that fit these requirements. After I tried on 3 dresses and wasn't impressed she asked \""Well, what do you want to do?\"" Really? This is my first time trying on dresses. I'd like to try on a few more. \n\nOverall it was a very uninspiring trip. My hopes were probably too high, but I had expected some small degree of pampering. Instead it felt like I was inconveniencing the salesperson with my \""outrageous\"" demands. Also, the selection of dresses wasn't as large as you would think. If you want an inexpensive strapless  gown I'm sure you could find something. If you want anything else you would do better elsewhere."
2	"The price and location was right, so we stayed here. \nCalled an hour ahead and booked 10 rooms!  Thought that my short notice and extra work load would PO the staff, (as I tend to do with the nature of the work), but they remained very friendly and helpful through out it all. \nThe rooms were Great. Clean linens and the Beds were super comfy, but anything beats the rocks we're used to sleeping on in camp."
2	"Helen (the owner) knows a lot about the food she sells.  Sometimes I'm in there too long talking about the variety and options, because my guys are picky and so am I.  She knows about the companies that make them, etc.  They also have great supplements, homeopathics, etc.  She also gives recommendations on good local vets that other customers like.  And they have great prices.   I also buy those little bulk cookies from the bins (some are wheat free and that's what I want).  Now for the admission on my part, I am on a healthy no sugar, wheat free diet (just like my babies) so I indulge in these little cookies myself.  My guys have to fight me for them.  Seriously.  They are yummy to all of our tummies!  I tell myself it's okay because they shouldn't have too much grains.  Ha."
1	"I will never go here again. So disappointed when I went in its a cute store don't get me wrong I would buy so much there for my dog. But the day I went I went to get a treat for my dog for his birthday. The lady was on her phone the whole time talking personal business while my mother and I stood they're waiting for her to get off or put the person on hold. All we wanted to do was to ask her to get that dog cookie for us. So after 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave and while walking out the door the lady shouted thanks for coming. That pissed me off cause she put down the phone to say bye but not to get an actual freaking sale. I'll continue going to to petsmart. Tried to support a local business but I guess when you own your own place you can have poor customer service"
2	"We needed some ear medication for one of the dogs so I called up around 12:30pm and asked for some more. They promptly looked up my puppy and asked when I wanted to pick it up, I said today. They reported that they closed in like 30 minutes; I said I could be there in 5. Went right in, they had it waiting for me, asked if I or the dog needed anything else, I paid and got out. Quick and Painless!"
1	"Recently visited, \n\nMy have they changed. I will just say I have never been treated so unprofessionally by anyone before in my life more so then I was by the staff at this establishment. \n\n15 years of business with the Veterinary staff which are exceptional. The twin sisters who work the front counter providing paper work, charges, scheduling who are also excellent.  \n\nWe scheduled 12-23-2013 for tests for heart guard. There was a mistake made from a previous visit which resulted in both the Veterinarian and the lady(someone I have never seen before) behind the counter becoming very hostile. Getting into a shouting match with me, getting hostile, telling me that's its all my opinon, I will say that I have never been treated so unprofessionally, especially when the error was on their end, basically took one dog that needed testing to buy two perscriptions, after test i was charged, doctor comes back says they need to examine the other dog, we did back in august of 2013. Turns out the person never charged us or documented properly but instead of either the Vet, or the women behind the counter listening to me explaining that we did come in August for the service I was met with an attitude like well this is how it is pay up or leave. They messed up our credit charges so badly we couldn't use for the rest of the week, luckily we were done with our holiday shopping. \n\nAsked for copies of my dogs charts received partials after repeat requests, had to go back to pick up a heart meds the following day and had them practically thrown at me by the same unprofessional women behind the counter. No eye contact no hello. Nothing. If that's what 15 years of business, two pets, at $250 a visit three times a year gets you. I will be giving that to someone else. \n\n****************************5 stars 11/14/2012 *************************\nWas able to bring both dogs, charged for 1 visit(realize a year later this wasn't a courtesy, this was their error) plus shots and meds. \n\nPrice were high, Vets are the best. No matter which vet I have met or have used they are all 100% professional and animal lovers. You would be surprised who aren't in this state. \n\nBoarding services, shots, meds, special care and even exotic animal care - we found a stray domestic rabbit, go figure."
2	"My background: I have 3 dogs and 3 cats and they all get the BEST care possible, at any cost.  I've taken them to many other vets in the area hoping for good care.  Three months ago, I need an appt for one of my dogs and couldn't get into my other vet for over a week. Then I found this place.  Dr. Jenkins is wonderful.  The staff (ladies at the desk and the vet techs) are all pleasant, kind and patient.  I don't feel like a number like at other vet clinics.  If you're frustrated with the other vets in Ahwatukee or around the valley, go to this one!  I'm sure all the vets are good, but I only know Dr. Jenkins and he is awesome."
1	"I gave them one star because their only saving grace was that they had Saturday hours and could get me in pretty quickly. \n\nHowever, when I brought my cat home from a tooth extraction I noticed that they had left his catheter in his leg. I had to go to an after hours animal hospital to have it safely removed. \nWhen they (AAC) sent us home from the tooth extraction they said they had run out of pain meds and to come back the next day. When we came back they told us that 1) the pain meds that were to be administered every 12 hours wouldn't be in until an unknown time and 2) that the vaccines my cat was supposed to receive were over looked and never given. I wouldn't even trust them to care for a pet rock.\n\nTotally disgusted!"
1	"If I could give this place no stars I would, heck id give them negative stars. I have never taken my dog there, thank freaking goodness, whoever the heck Claudia is, she is EXTREMELY rude! And VERY condescending! If you love your pet DO NOT bring them here I can only imagine how she would treat your furry loved one if she treats you like crap!!! Go somewhere else!!!!"
2	"When it comes to a vet, we all must learn to he patient with, and understand that, the front desk and techs have very stressful jobs. There will be times, at any and every vet office that these people will have bad days. But, for the most part, they are there because they love animals and want to the best for your pets...\n\nWith that said, I am writing this review solely based on my dog's vet, Dr. Hertzig. I have bringing my pitbull-mix here since I found her as a stray, almost four years now.\n\nWhen I first started going, it was because it was close to my house. I moved quite a bit away about two years ago, and I keep bringing my dog here because I believe in Dr Hertzig, and she is a very calm and comfortable doctor. She seems to really care for my dog, and is very easy to talk with and be around. She doesn't push me to do things I don't need for my dog, and is overall a very nice person on top of being a good doctor.\n\nI would recommend anyone new to the area, or looking for a new vet, try meeting Dr Hertzig, and see for yourself how well she will work for you and your pet."
2	"I'm at this Target what seems to be at a minimum of once a week. The staff is nice and lines are generally not too long!\n\nThe store has always been clean and items have not been out of stock.\n\nI feel the layout of the store could be done slightly better than the current arrangement.  A very minor issue.\n\nThis Target has a small food section. All the items I've purchased in the freezer/refrigerated or pantry items have always been fresh.\n\nThe worst part of going to this Target is making a left onto 48th street during certain hours of the day. With the traffic on 48th/Ray and the shopping center across the street, turning can be a challenge."
1	"The WORST experience I have had in a store.  Recently went to the store to pick up a few items.  There were 2 prices for one item.  When, I got to the cashier, she huffed and threw things around.  Called customer service and they gave a lame apology.  I will never go back!"
1	"This Target feels somewhat old and run-down compared to the brand-new one close to the Chandler Fashion Center mall.  They do have a large garden center that is housed in a separate building so that is nice but really I find that it is usually cheaper to get what you need at Lowes or Home Depot.\n\nThe last time we were here I did notice that they have the nice, new plastic shopping carts that are so much easier to push.  So, that is a plus.  Also, there was a sign that they are expanding their grocery section and a portion of the store was under construction so it appears that they will soon have a fully stocked store with fresh produce in addition to the small dry food and dairy/frozen cases that they already have."
2	"4 stars because the staff are always helpful and willing to help. 1 star left off due to lack of \""one-plus-one\"" monitoring. The Lead always seems to walk around fast talking on their radio, but no additional registers opened."
1	"Absolute WORST customer service at this store.\n\nOn one particular day I was in this store looking for bath bubbles. Couldn't find bath bubbles to save my life! And also couldn't find an employee to save my life. After I walked around many isles aimlessly looking for someone to help me, I came across a female employee. Before I could even finish asking her where the bath bubbles were, she had already started walking away from me! She mumbled something and pointed in the general direction she thought they were. Gee, huge help! NOT."
2	"I enjoy my time shopping at this Target while I was in the area after dinner.  And since I used to work in the area on 48th St. & Chandler Blvd., I know the area quiet well.  This store is very bright and all their aisles are very clean.  The store sells everything from your household goods like electronics items from TV or cell phones to your home fridge need such as dry good, ice cream, yogurt, milk, and eggs.\n\nI don't believe that this store is a 24-hour store, so better call the store first before heading out.  Don't want you to come all the way out to the store and then find out they are closed for the night."
2	"Most Target stores, usually run the same. Great Guess Service, keeping the lines down as much as they can, cleanliness, etc. No Starbucks kind of sucks though. They need to work on asking the guess, if they need anything. I passed by employees and other people and the employees dont say anything! Work on this Ahwatukee Target but I still love shopping here!"
2	"I get my prescriptions filled here and I shop here at least once a week. Always clean and most of the time the staff is friendly. They have all that I need and I always pay with my Target card to get the 5% off."
2	"Love target! Great products and an amazing return policy!"
1	"I visited this location on 12/16/2014 4:59pm. I purchased a few items and went to checkout. The check out girl , I do not recall her name but she had purple hair, seemed in a rush to leave. She was telling the guest in front of me , when she was asked if she was ready for Christmas that her last paycheck was only 60.00 and how was she suppose to buy gifts with that. Wow! ok so maybe Target doesn't pay that well, but that is not my issue. My issue is I presented her with 4 coupons and when I asked did you take all 4 off she said yes, without even looking at her screen.  I got my receipt and sure enough she left off one of the coupons. It's not about the dollar, trust me , if the fact she did not bother to double check and I did not want to hold up a line espically at this time in the season.  Looking at the receipt there is no receipt number or name or anything to show who checked me out. All I can tell you is she had purple hair and it was long. I am going to post this on yelp also. I used to love Target but this experience made me think you are guys are just like Walmart now and that is sad."
1	"Worst printing service I ever had. The employee raped my friend's bank accounts by misquoting them and giving them zero options. We are design students at asu and were very dissatisfied with the overall experience that was offered. I will never bring my business to this location or any other fedex office or junkie locations again."
1	"There were 2 associates working tonight and a line of 4-5 people.  One associate was assisting a customer with a ridiculous amount of chit chat.  At one point I thought I overheard them talking about cats and flags.  Although I do appreciate her assisting someone else, she also began to write down step by step on a piece of paper on how to do something in Photoshop, really?  What happen to Google or even typing this information out to make things move along faster?  She literally stood there for 10 mins writing instructions on a piece of paper!  \n\n\nThe other associate finished assisting one customer and completely ignored the line, she stayed in her corner with her shipping boxes, I understand the importance of putting these boxes in order so they can be mailed out TOMORROW, but ignoring the line in front of you and NOT even greeting anyone is ridiculous to me.  What happen to good old customer service with a smile?  \n\nThese two associates were rude, slow, and ignored the line of customers in front of them.  I waited almost 20 minutes to print out my sheets!  I tried using their self service printing machine and the usb port was not working.  Never coming here again, overall horrid experience!"
2	"This place is great! I love getting the first morning appointment. I'm in, they clean my teeth, and I'm out. Super easy and very friendly. They always call to confirm the day before and send the reminder card in the mail a few weeks before. Plus, if you go for cleaning every six months, you get two free tubes of whitening gel!!"
1	"Do not go to this office unless you want to be ripped off. I have been going to this group for 12 years. I have seen dentists come and go and never once have I had one cavity or had any spots even 'flagged'. I saw a new dentist this time and she not only talked down to me as if I was a child, she told me I have two cavities that needed filled.  They chose to show me \""pictures\"" of my teeth and not the X-rays trying to make the case. Really?! I can tell you where I WON'T be going for my next cleaning."
1	"First, when reading reviews,  I think it is important to look at dates of last review. Although there are reviews for this office they are over a year + old so here is a current one. \n\n I took my daughter here for an issue she had from a previous dentist and the doctor we saw was OK BUT the billing practices are to say the least questionable! I gave them my insurance information on the spot and was told they would get back to me on the cost of the work that my daughter needed to have done. Later that evening I actually received a call from the office requesting I pay my deductible right then. I advised I would not do that and wanted to wait to see what the actual bill came to after going through my insurance but they insisted it was a \""fee for service\"" based office and I needed to make that payment. \n\nI obliged and sent in a check for the full deductible against my better judgment and I WAS  RIGHT!  A few days later I got an explanation of benefits from my provider that stated the \""contracted and allowed amount\"" was only 1/2 of what they charged me for. After a lengthy and frustrating call to their \""office manager\""  she insisted I was incorrect that they had a \""fax\"" that showed what I should pay \""if I came in she could show it to me and go over it with me\"" and I would have to call my provider. So, as if I get paid to do their job,  I took time from my own business to do their job and spoke with my provider and again I was RIGHT. \n\nThey are trying to charge me for charges that were not allowed by my provider..... When they finally  receive their copy of the explanation of benefits (not a generic fax) they will see they were incorrect. Now, lets just see if they make right with me and refund me the amount I overpaid. \n\nKeep in mind the next visit they wanted me to just hand over  $ 617.00 because they said that is what that charge will be... No thanks!"

1	"I have never been to the Ahwatukee Country Club before March 31, 2013, Easter Sunday.  I guess I set my expectations too high.  When we arrived, there where many empty tables (that should have been our first clue).  We were escorted to our table by the bar in the room furthest away from the buffet.  There were some dirt marks on the tableclothes but it looked like they were stained.  Maybe they should have reconsidered using those ones.  We sat for a few minutes before our server told us she would be right with us.  About 4 minutes or so later she came over to take our drinnk order.  There were 5 of us.  She got 4 drink orders and walked away.  We had to call her back when she said she hadn't realized she didn't get my order.  We also had to ask her if it was okay to go to the buffet.  I think she was the only server working as I did not see any one else in that capacity.  When we walked over to the buffet table, there were no plates.  SERIOUSLY, NO PLATES!  There were two gentlemen in front of us that told us the person carving went to go get plates.  He brought about 10 which was ok for that moment.  The first chafing dish contained the eggs and potatoes.  The eggs loooked like they were overcooked and sitting there for a while.  The \""fresh cut potatoes\"" were actually the best tasting item they had available.  The next chafing dish had bacon and sausage.  I prefer my bacon well done and none of it looked like it was cook that way.  The sausage looked greasy.  Next was the petite assorted quiche.  There was no sign to tell me what kind of quiche were there and they looked like they bought them from a bulk store instead of being freshly made. Chicken Marsala was next.  There were a few pieces left.  I was putting a lot of hope in this dish as it is one of my favorites.  It was way too salty.  This leads me to think that it was pre-made as well as a good chef would taste the food that they make to insure proper seasoning.  Then we had a chafing dish with a spoonful of mashed potatoes and some asparagus spears.  I had to locate the carving person to let him know we needed more vegatables.  Thank goodness he asked what else was needed, oh wait, I think someone from the staff should have been checking to make sure there was enough food available for the restaurant guests. Now we come to the salad.  It was so picked over and visually unappealing, I decided to pass.  However, the rolls they had were very good.  Since the carver person was busy refilling the chafing dishes, we had to get the ham and beef ourselves.  Please see the picture that I have uploaded.  NO BEEF and a small chunk of ham and a big chunk of fat.   So we returned to our table and picked at our food.  Our drinks were served, however the server was unaware of how to make a Shirley Temple.  That would be okay, but just ask.  I would rather be asked then served the wrong drink.  We had to return the drinks and tell her how to make them.  So we finish our lackluster meal and go to the \""dessert station.\""  Please see the picture.  Picked over red velvet cake, some chocolate cake, some pastries, a tiny bit of cheesecake, bite size eclairs with melty chocolate and sticking together in the center of a plate surrounded by not very good cinnamon rolls.  The Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was the peach pie in the silver tin.  Okay, so I was looking for a less expensive meal for Easter dinner for five people.  It ended up costing $160 and I was not only upset about what we paid but I was embarassed that I made the suggestion to go there.  This may be an okay place for a drink and a sandwich after a round of golf but they do not know how to do brunch.  I don't htink I would even consider them for any function after our experience there."
1	"Its this one Sunday where i over slept and wake up feeling i have lost the whole day.... Had a quick bite and drove around and stumble upon Ahwatukee CC. As i remember one of my colleague told me a must play course. So without checking the web, i went in pay for twilight and start my round. Overall is a public/municipal course and its old and abused without much care. Flat and pretty much surrounded my houses. If i had to force it i would say its the longer PAR 3 where there is water hazard on the left that i could remember (maybe). That day the pin was tug left and i usually draw my shot so its a little intimidating to attack, plus the sun setting in the horizon is right in the middle of my face when teeing off. Very cheap but i won't go back unless i am given a free round with my buddy while i don't have other priority."
2	"Great course for the money! Its location is primo and I love that for a short drive you can feel like you are on vacation. I adore the views of the mountains in the distance and I like that this course is manageable. I prefer the front nine to the back, which is good since I'm usually only up for nine holes... Then its time to hit the bar!"
2	"I was referred to this auto mechanic by my daycare director at the time. I have a car that's almost 9 years old and has 215k + miles on it. I let them know I am new to the state and need a reliable and trust worthy mechanic. I also let them know I am not in a position to replace my car, so I need to take care of it best I can. I have sent my car there 3 times now and all 3 times I have been very satisfied with their rates and service. They keep track of my repairs and send me reminders for my oil changes. They also give me suggestions for repairs. I am able to rest easy when I have to get repairs done knowing they are using their best experts to advise me and aren't the type of mechanic to overcharge me for labor. They also give a very detailed receipt so I can see what costs the most for each repair. Love this place!"
2	"The mechanics here have been nothing but helpful and fair!  I've had to come in several times and the last \""simple\"" repair could have been worse and they did their best to keep the cost down.  Any mechanic who is fair and honest gets my vote!  Thanks Glen and Ben!"
1	"I recently had gone to Greulich's to get an estimate because my car failed emissions testing due to an air-leak, and the intake tube was torn on my Honda Accord.  Somehow these clowns road up an estimate for $900+ to get this fixed, and then the moron behind the counter actually stated that he won't charge me a diagnosis fee, but that I should tip his worker for diagnosing it.  I will say, that $4 tip I gave the mechanic was the best tip I ever gave, because I went to TEMPE HONDA, at the South Autoplex Loop and they gave me an estimate for the same exact problem and even took care of the job for only $107, and gave me the best service and professionalism I've been handed in years!!  GREULICH's is not to be trusted!! I will never go here again!  \n I had a similar experience about 5 years ago at a Greulich's just off of the 51 and Greenway Rd in North Phoenix, As I re-call they fixed the problem with my car for a very hefty fee, and this is why I have been somewhat hesitant in taking my car there...just from that one experience 5 years ago.  Well this just confirmed by belief.  Everybody needs to know about this highway ROBBERY!"
2	"Great Service!  Car was over heating and check engine light was on.  This has been building and I knew it was going to be bad but wanted Greulich's opinion.  They fit me right in at 5p on Friday.  Called me the next morning and told me the news.  The repair was going to cost more than my 15+ year old car was worth but I knew I was driving on borrowed time the the last 12 months, so I am OK with that.  Glenn the shop manager wouldn't even charge me for the diagnosis and their time.  When was the last time that happened to you!  The even picked me up so I could \""coax\"" my car home!"
1	"I was calling around for break pad/rotor prices and called this shop based on the good reviews. I told the gentleman on the phone that I have an 2008 Mazda 6 and its a 4 cylinder. He then told me there is no such thing as a 4 cylinder in a Mazda 6  that's why it's called a Mazda 6 because it's a 6 cylinder. I told him he was incorrect it was a 4 cylinder. He told me I was incorrect. I said, \""Okay thanks anyhow\"". I then called Mazda  in Mesa where I bought my car,  thinking I have been wrong for 5 years. They laughed and said, \""Nope that's just the model name, it has nothing to do with the cylinders.\"" So when should you not go to an auto shop? When you know more than they do."
2	"Not only have we always experienced great service here, but I appreciate the straight talk.  They are respectful in ways that other automotive shops are not.  They always give us whatever discount they are currently running, even if we don't ask.  They have even gone out of their way to save us a little bit of money on some expensive repairs."
1	"Pretty lame subs and sandwiches. Worked close by so tried a few times. Hate to say it, but Subway is much better. Quality and quantity of ingredients in the so so bread left a lot to be desired.\n\nService was okay but nothing to Yelp positively about."
1	"The sandwiches are pretty good, I believe I had the Ham & Swiss on my last trip there. The food portions are bigger than I can eat and the sandwiches are nice and melty. The shop itself is small- order at the counter and they'll call out when your order is ready.\n\nSubFactory isn't my favorite sandwich shop, and I probably wouldn't ever pick this place to eat, but I wouldnt be opposed to going if someone else wanted to."
2	"I have been going to the Sub Factory for years now and it's always delivered a great sub... But I have only ordered one each time the Pastrami Deluxe (melted cheese, fried bell peppers, grilled onions, mushrooms, mustard, pickle... Wow this is one great sub a must try for anyone looking for a great sub."
1	"Came here to try something new.  I'm not coming back.\n\nLet's back up a bit.  The sub is decent, a shade higher than subway quality, but that shade might need to be measured by NASA.  Had a hot sub, was heated up in a microwave.  I can do that at home cheaper and without cooking it to the consistency of beef jerky.\n\nHere is what started to get me... I paid for the combo meal, which is 2 dollars and something for a fun size bag of chips and a drink.  Fountain drink stand has dust on it, bad sign.  What does that take that wipe down?  5, maybe 10 seconds? I get a fork at the straw/lid/silverware station afterwards.  4 crumbled up straw wrappers in the silverware station, on top of the forks.  I elect to eat without a fork.\n\nDid the guy who just walked out of the john wash his hands before he took off his straw wrapper with his genital holding hands and throw it in the fork tray?  I have no idea...\n\nSanitation on that situation = 0.  Guy working in the back was rocking out to the radio.  Confirmed that when I washed my hands after eating and saw him in the kitchen with the door wide open to said work station.  I think checking that area is low on the list of priorities, as evidence would suggest.\n\nHere is what really pisses me off.  My chips taste terrible.  Not crunchy at all.  Came in on 12/18/2012, chips expired on 12/4/1012.  These are nacho cheese Doritos.  Sure, probably somewhat safe to eat a year after that but taste like shit.  My concern is if no one is looking at the expiration date on the chips, are they looking at it on the microwaved meat I just ate?  Or the cold meat they serve?  \n\nBottom line, I don't like eating anywhere that openly advertises they sell expired food.  The chips proved that to me.  Really wish I would have seen that before I ate a few chips before seeing the expiration date and threw the rest of them away in the garbage which is what this place should have done before selling them.    Plenty of other sub shops very close to here I would assume do not do that, I'll give them my cash instead.  You have now been dubbed \""Sub Craptory,\"" until you get your act together.  Sure, I could have told someone that works there I bought expired food, but I already have a job.  I don't need to do yours.  I'm just never coming back again.\n\nExpired food = automatic one star.  Congratulations.\n\nI don't know, we are only 2 days away from 12/21/2012, maybe this is what the Mayan's predicted, people would eat your expired food here and all die of food poisoning and that is what ends the world.  I hope not.  That would suck."
1	"Two thumbs down!\n\nThis was my first time trying \""sub factory\"" since I recently moved into the nieghborhood and this was the only place for subs that didn't appear to be a \""chain\"" sub shop. I ordered the \""meatball\"" sub with the normal toppings, onion, peppers, cheese. \nWhen I brought the sub home I was really excited to try it, then the dissapointment came. The bread was just ok it didn't look baked fresh, it seemed to be a kind of roll you buy at your local market that was split in half, not actual sub roll. The meatballs were sitting in what appeared to be canned crushed tomatoes, no seasoning nothing, it was pretty gross, no real italian marinara, then it had sliced onion, which was not cooked, then whatever cheese that seemed to be on it was only on the side of the sub. The meatballs tasted like the frozen kind you buy at the store and tasted like they where rehydrated and soaked in water, they were dry, bland and just plain gross.\n After only a couple of bites I was grossed out by the whole thing,  I turned and gave it to my dog.  \n\nSub Factory was a total waste of my money and time.\n\nNote: \nWhen you own a little independant food chain , you are supposed to \""kick butt\"" and go the extra mile with your food, and your customers.  I wasn't satisfied or impressed as a customer,\n\n I will NOT be back, not even for free food, it's that gross........."
2	"I LOVE THIS STORE.  It is by far, my favorite craft store by far. Here's why.\n\nFirst off, its huge.  I love Joanns ETC/superstores.  Their large, clean, well lit, and the staff here is always friendly and helpful.  The store is well set up.  Fabric is usually in the front, with loads of selections.  Sewing, candles, scrapbooking, stamping, you name it, they have it.\n\nI shop here regularly.  Weather its for Scrapbooking, home decor, fabric, whatever, I feel like I could just shop shop shop!   I like how clean it is as well.  Floors are nice, shelves seem organized and clean, along with everything else in the store.\n\nThey have so much product here to choose from, and I think they always seem to have great sales going.  I enjoy it here immesly.  Ive also interacted with the staff here on multiple occasions. Friendly, personable, and definately help me find my stuff or make reccomendations when needed."
1	"This store is huge and has lots and lots of products.  I was happy to shop searching out their sale items, until I was checking out.  They falsely advertise their sale items.  Today I went to purchase their \""Camp Kids\"" products that were on sale at 50% off.  As I was checking out, they claimed that the paintable bobble heads were not included.  Then they claimed the other \""Camp kids\"" products were not included as well.  All of the products that I had chosen was on the sale rack with the sale sign over it.  I specifically made sure I read the \""sale sign\"" correctly and yet they refused to honor it.  I will never go back.  I don't trust what they advertise.  If you choose to shop their.... better check your receipt."
1	"I went to this store to return some scrapbooking supplies. I wasn't sure if only one cashier accepted returns, so I had to interrupt the cashier at customer service. I felt terrible for doing it, as I know it is terribly rude, but I just wanted to make sure I wasn't falling into a line I didn't need to. After saying excuse me, the cashier did not answer nor acknowledge my presence, so I said, \""excuse me\"" a little louder and I get a cold \""hold on Ma'am.\"" I'm terribly sorry you are busy and I interrupted you, but a simple acknowledgement in your facial expression would have sufficed. \n\nThe part that really irked me was while she was scanning my many items, she made a comment, \""you did KEEP some things, right?!\"" Excuse me? I just went to Michael's and returned $40 worth of scrapbooking supplies in which I had originally spent $50 and I did not hear a single peep from their cashier. I still ended up spending $70 at Jo Ann's with my return. I completely understand and I absolutely hate to do it, but you have a return policy that could easily state that scrapbook supplies are excluded. They are tiny items and I'm sure are a pain to re-stock, but your corporation does not say that I cannot return my unused scrapbooking supplies. On top of that, you are located within a 1 mile radius of TWO other art supply stores, I'm sure it happens. \n\nI have dealt with difficult customers all of my life and never once let my emotions or aggravation show, especially a sassy remark like that. So, to my cashier, Barbara Ann, your attitude just cost you a customer. I will not be giving Jo Ann Fabrics any of my business."
1	"whenever we've gone there, there's rarely anyone to help you. The lady at the cutting table always seems overwhelmed, too.  The checkout line is long and atrocious. Last night we went in so I could look for a pattern to make my son a Christmas jacket out of velvet. None of their books had patterns for special occasions for boys, and of course there was no one to be found except a lady vacuuming who didn't look like she wanted to talk to anyone (or maybe she didn't speak English and that's why she didn't make eye contact)."
1	"I hate being so mean about a Jo-Ann's but I am DONE with the registers. \n\nI make decisions to NOT come here because the lines are so ridiculous. Why do they have 9 registers and 1 person ringing ALL THE TIME!!! Infuriating.  Plus, I feel like I ALWAYS have to interrupt the cashier because the only people working at Jo-Ann's are 1 cashier and 2 people cutting fabric. I have never in my 10+ times in this store seen an associate who is not in one of those three positions.  It is SO maddening!!!\n\nBring on AT LEAST one more associate because at least I can find help at Michaels, and if I can't find it there, I'd rather buy my item on Amazon to avoid the BULLSH*T at Jo-Ann's.\n\nP.S. I even have a vested interest in this store as I took a sewing and a cake decorating class here and I am tired of the place sucking so bad."
1	"Same as other reviews a bunch of registers and one cashier I been waiting at customer service trying to see what other store has more if the item I need I been waiting for over 30 minute cashier ignoring and avoiding eye contact no mas"
1	"SLOW SLOW SLOW!!!!!!!!!!!!\nMost associates at the cutting table don't want to wait on customers?!!!! I have shopped there several times and ALWAYS leave shaking my head wondering \""how does this place stay in business?\""!!!!!!\nI love seeing and feeling fabric before I buy it but I really don't want to shop at this Jo-Ann store. \nToday there were two associates helping one customer at the cutting table. After waiting five minutes, one stopped consulting and decided to stack fabrics as I waited. I went ahead and placed my fabric on the counter in the hopes that employee #2 would see a customer in need but employee #1 said that she would be with me in a minute. I asked, \""Can't she help me?\"", pointing to the stacker. They looked at each other and the stacker came over to cut my fabric. She was nice enough but it seems the entire store needs a lesson on customer service and speed. \nI have gone to the Jo-Ann store in Casa Grande and always have a great experience. \nIf you are reading this, Ray Road Manager, PLEASE GET YOUR STORE TRAINED!!!!!!"
1	"I worked at a Joanns in high school, and I still love the company. However, this store is poorly maintained. I needed food coloring and a turn table for cake decorating. All of the cake decorating items are squeezed into an aisle with a pillar in the middle. Stuff was spilling onto the floor and I couldn't get my cart down the aisle. A messy store is normal for a busy Sunday, but I went in maybe 30-45 minutes after opening. I eventually found the turn table on a display in a different aisle, but there was no price. There were a variety of items on the display, and not a single one had a price sticker or a label on the display. It was like they put anything that didn't have a home onto the display, regardless if they went together. I walked around, trying to find someone to ask the price and there was no one to be found. There were 2 ladies cutting fabric, one at customer service and one at another register. The line to checkout was 10 people deep and I wasn't going to wait just to ask a price. Since they were out of the other item I was looking for anyway, I put the turn table back and went to Michaels in the same shopping center. It was a night and day difference with wide aisles, clean and stocked shelves and clearly marked prices. There were 3 people ringing and I got to my car with both items under 15 minutes. I even saw 3 people walking around the store offering help and straightening. I am sad to say that I will not be returning to this Joanns again."
2	"So, for the most part, everyone always dreads going to the dentist, either out of fear of pain or the bill. I know I chose the latter for a good portion of my life and knew the day would come when it would \""bite\"" me in the butt.....sorry. Low and behold at the ripe age of 31, 16 years since my last visit to a dentist, three wisdom teeth decided to show me who's boss. Looks like this dental plan is about to pay off...\n\nI'm in a new state, I don't have a dentist or a doctor....... or a psychiatrist (if you were curious). Where do I go? Luckily I have a boss and friend named Amber Williams (plug) who pointed me in the right direction. Also conveniently located around the corner from my place, Today's Dental was the \""place to be\"". Nervously, I made my call to schedule an appointment and was immediately put at ease by the almost impossibly friendly staff. But I knew what was coming, they couldn't fool me. \n\nIn I walked and signed in at the front desk, their smiles and helpfulness, there's no way this is real. I was called in and taken on a tour of the facilities, and I thought that was very very very very cool for some reason. I must have looked like I was 6 years old walking around there. Like a giant 6ft 3in six-year-old. I got in my room and there's TV's on the wall, on the ceiling, all playing Sports Center, are you *^&%^*&ing kidding me??  I was so excited at this point I didn't care what they did, just let me sit down and you guys can get to work. By the way, I'm sorry if this is not at all exciting to you because you go to the dentist all the time like a normal person, but this is crazy to me. \n\nIn short of losing site of the actual review I'll sum this up. My dentist was Dr. DeMark and he's pretty much the coolest guy you could ever hope to have ripping bones from your head. I was at no time uncomfortable and actually wouldn't have minded another 20- 30 minutes. He really might be the coolest guy I've ever met in general now that I think about it. Believe me, this was no easy surgery, but I walked out of there with a giant swollen smile on my face. I was thoroughly educated in how to take care of myself during the healing process and got a phone call later that night from the Dr making sure I was alright and checking that I understood what to do. I mean if this is the typical experience then I'm surprised, it was a pleasure all around and I will never go to another dentist. \n\nIn short, if you're like me and have been an idiot for not going to the dentist, or if you're new to the area looking for a new dentist...go here...because I said so. I honestly can't wait to go back."
2	"I travel from Tolleson here and there is a dentist right across the street from my house. That's how much I love this place. I have really bad teeth and always need something when I go to the dentist. I have had 3 crowns done here and every time it's a breeze. They make it super comfortable and even have TVs on the ceiling for you to watch. The best part is they have a CEREC machine which creates a permanent crown for you right on the spot. No wearing a temporary and waiting two weeks. Only a few places in the valley have this.\n\nMy dentist is Dr. DeMark and he is the best dentist I've ever been too. He makes my appointments painless and easy. He even calls you that night to make sure everything is ok. \n\nThe office is super clean and the staff is super friendly. As long as I live in the Phoenix area I will always come here."
2	"The Dentist is tops , state of the Art Equipment\nFast and most of all painless. Good payment plans.\nClean and comfortable. Highly recommend ."
2	"I've reviewed my current dentist but I never forget Todays Dental! I had to stray due to the fact that Todays Dental isn't able to do a payment plan for the amount of work I have needed (needing my 8th root canal currently) At my new dentist I have spent over 3.5k on dental work...paid in full as of today :)\n\nBack to Todays Dental and the best dentist, hands down, Dr. DeMark!!! He is a wonderfully gifted dentist! Great bedside manner, very engaging and very attentive! He calls after a procedure to make sure you're alright, and during the procedure he is explaining every step he takes. My new dentist is so nice but the person they had do my root canals was sent right up from HELL lol If I am ever in need of another, which I actually am, I will gladly walk into Todays Dental, cash in hand! Since I was paying off the 3.5k at the other dentist, I still had a balance at Todays Dental and they were so patient with me about it and didn't bother me for months and I apologize for them having to even deal with that! The front office staff is great, the hygienists are just as great and of course, if you couldn't already tell, Dr. DeMark is super great!"
2	"I had the best possible experience a person can have at a Dentist office. Easily 5 stars...\n\nMy last visit to a dentist office was just plain awful and scary. So I was a bit anxious and apprehensive, but I ended up leaving with a smile on my face. The staff here are top notch professionals. They are friendly and thoughtful and made me feel completely comfortable. Jan took me back to an exam room and had me laughing and feeling right at ease. Which is pretty important in a typically unpleasant place (who likes getting their mouth poked?). She was just a wonderful and nice woman.\n\nThen in comes Dr. Howard Farran, who had me rolling right from the get go. So funny and super knowledgeable! He seemed to take a genuine interest in my visit and made me feel like I came to the right place. I actually learned quite a bit just from talking with him. He explained all my options and his recommendations. No pressure or up-selling. Great guy. Great Doctor.\n\nI'll be back in a couple weeks... and dare I say I'm actually looking forward to my next visit."
2	"Appointment at 130 for paperwork, evaluation for repair that needed to be done, work started immediately upon my approval.  I'm out of the chair before 5 p.m. with a crown, not a temp either.  Jann had an ease in her technique.   Dr. Faran was pleasant and charming.\nToday is my last day until next year.  I've had a root canal & crown, a cleaning, and another crown since the first appointment.  Yes it had been a while.  Glad to have found a dental office that's relaxed, mostly on schedule, and they don't give me the impression that they're trying to sell me on something more than what is needed.\nMy son also comes to this office and says they are much more gentle than what he dealt with at the pediatric dental office.  So what does that tell ya?"
2	"I always enjoy my annual eye exam here.  Overall, this is an excellent office with great Doctors and Staff.  I always feel they take the time to see each patient and answer all my questions.  It always has a very warm and inviting atmosphere, which is very important to me having been to other medical offices that were not welcoming at all."
2	"I knew someone who recommended Arizona Hair Co but I always am skeptical of chains.  This time was different. Both my toddlers were agreeable to a haircut and my last haircut was 4 months ago.  I normally have to squeeze in an appt during my lunch hour.  But yesterday, a Saturday, my kids were done playing at Chuck E Cheese's in Ahwatukee and I noticed the salon still open.  Because every free minute counts, I took a chance and walked in.  $10 only for a kids cut, yeah.  Then after only waiting less than 5 minutes (there were 5-6 stylists this day after 4pm) both my kids were in booster seats.  After looking over the stylists who seemed trendy and experienced, I asked for a cut, too. Nicole was very quick and experienced.  I have never looked so good with straight hair!  She put long layers in and I can't believe I didn't give them a try sooner.  I usually go to Carsten's Aveda School of Cosmetology on Rural in Tempe for its location and scalp massages.  I will definitely go back to the Ahwatukee location of Arizona Hair Co.  My kids' hair turned out very nice, too!"
2	"After a bad bleaching job done by another place, Stacey got me in right away. She was pleasant, patient, and all around she made me feel at home, which is exactly what I needed. She was very good in her recommendations and spot on with the color I wanted. She toned my hair which only took 20 minutes and I am super happy with the results. Such a life saver she is! Thanks again"
2	"I haven't been to Dr. Woodland since I was in grade school, however I am confident that he was great! I remember going to him a lot in the second grade and I was so embarrassed because I thought that meant I had bad teeth. Several years later, I said something to my mom about going to the dentist so often when I was a kid, and she told me that I wasn't getting fillings, I was getting sealants!!! What a relief to know I did NOT have bad teeth! I still try to keep that going ... Every 6 months for me, like clockwork! \n\nI have never had any fear or anxiety about going to the dentist and from the stories that I hear, I seem to be in the minority on that one. Seeing as how I was going all the time when I was younger (or what seemed like it to a second grader) and I still don't mind the dentist, almost enjoy it in fact, I am fully convinced that is a direct result of my first dental experience with Dr. Woodland!"
1	"Dr. Mark Woodland did such poor work on fillings in my families mouth that the next dentist we went to said we should file a lawsuit.\n\nNot only is his work 2nd rate but we are seriously considering filing a suit. \n\nThis man should not be practicing Dentistry."
2	"Best experience I have had. I've spent soc years looking for a barber that not only provided the level of service i needed, but one that had the \""barber shop\"" feel to it. Every time I would find one, the barber would transfer elsewhere, but then I found this one. Walking in after work, Boris took me in and gave me a cut. I wasn't expecting the hot towel, straight edge, or even to like my cut (been so desensitized by Supercuts), but it's safe to say that I'll call this \""home\"" and come for as long as they have an \""open\"" sign."
2	"My mother is a hair stylist in California and the only person who I trusted to cut my hair for most of my life. That is until I met Boris at Ahwatukee Barbers. Now, I trust him with my hair more than I trust my own mother. I'm never disappointed by his work. When I was in law enforcement, he always gave me the perfect high and tight. Nowadays, he does an excellent job with more adventurous cuts like the undercut. Haircuts are only fifteen bucks. Don't forget to tip your barber!"
2	"Ugh, Phoenix has got such a dearth of competent barbers.  Boris is literally the only one I've found.  I was on the verge of shaving my head before I met Boris."
2	"I found ALC by way of my insurance search engine looking for a new Chiropractor. I went in for a consult and immediately loved the environment. Dr. Morley saw me immediately and gave me an adjustment. He was forthright and transparent about my medical needs and billing options. Saw me right away the next day for an adjustment and is just wonderful."
2	"Great service, easy and convenient location. Clothes returned just right!"
1	"So far I'm not happy. I dropped off a coat to be cleaned and have a button sewed on. It was supposed to be ready Friday evening. But when I came to pick it up, my coat was the only item not ready. No apologies, not even a courtesy call to let me know? Disappointing."
2	"Looking for casual \""dive type\"" yet clean?  Great place here!  Mind you, when I say \""dive\"" -to me this term is a positive, endearing term that means friendly people with a \""local's\"" feel.  Friday nights typically consist of some really great bands; and Sat. nights for poker --free play, no buy in!  Although -the 7pm start is the more die-hard serious players...the 10 p.m. start seems more laid back by this time and this is the round where I jump in with my less than stellar knowledge of poker and just want to have some fun interaction!  The staff is really great --they are who they are and don't pretend to be anyone else --I love interecting with the \""real\"" personalities of the staff and the patron's all interact easily whether they know you or not.  When you order a drink -treat the staff like a friend you just met -and not \""wait staff\"" -they will remember you and appreciate that you recognize they are working hard for you and everyone around you!  A very friendly local's hang out --so whether you are from North Phoenix or out of state vacationing -visit this place for a friendly interaction with the locals -casual atmosphere with all walks of life -great pool playing and people watching on any night!"
1	"if you're on social security, or your kids and grandkids have left you alone for the weekend ... you should bring your AARP  card... yes you will still have to pay a $5 cover ..... but.... dont worry the smell of the B.o., Vicks,  and Tacos will surely either send you to the promise land or Revive the dead"
1	"Been to the place a couple times now...staff is OK other than a few people who take bar conversations more seriously than customers...but I digress.  Prices are a little steep for what's considered a \""dive bar\"".  As far as a live band venue goes, young bands may want to stick with the either known or upcoming scenes in tempe.  Chances are, if you play at cactus, you or your friends may get in a random fight with a drunk regular but that's what the bar is.  Its a local, regular patrons only dive bar.  Just my advice and overall feedback."
1	"Decent food here. Recently  the entertainment has been downgraded. They used to have established bands that fit the demographic of the area. We used to have a great night out listening to very good bands here. Now, they have two or three bands per night. Typically, they are quite a bit younger and a good fit for a college area. It is  typically bands just starting out, not established valley bands.  This downgrade came with a cover charge. So, most of the locals and regulars no longer go here for their music  fix. Our friends that used to be regulars found new venues, we have also. This is a decent place to grab a beer and watch a ball game. It is not a good place for live music any longer, that is a shame."
2	"Went to listen to some live music. I was really, really impressed with Ruca. I stayed longer than I had planned because the band, Ruca, was so great. I was delightfully surprised at how good the food was! The service was great and our server was attentive and friendly. Our drinks were delicious and potent. I would definitely recommend!!"
2	"Amateur Hour: How Dinner Could Have Gone Terribly Wrong But Somehow Ended Up Being Rock Solid\n\nThe setting: New Year's Eve, six o'clock, South Tempe and Ahwatukee\nThe players: The ravenous Mr. Man and Me, a Black Mitsubishi Montero on a mission\n\nGranted, going out for dinner on New Year's Eve is by and large a mistake. Holidays are the times when it's most likely the stresses placed on the kitchen and wait staff may result in frazzled service and a less than savory dining experience. But ramen for dinner was out of the question. (I've tried to keep that survival food to a minimum since graduating.) So what's a gal to do? \n\nHop into the hooptyville and cruise in search of something better than soggy shoestrings. Doesn't sound like much of a challenge at first until our two players realize that it's New Year's Even and they're pretty fucked for A) Places that still have seats open cuz all the smart folks made reservations, B) Places that are open at all cuz nobody wants to work when there's bubbly to be had and C) Places other than 24 hour greasy spoons cuz even fast food joints close on New Year's Eve.\n\n45 minutes elapse in which our players dart in and out of establishments encountering option A, drive by potential restaurants while encountering option B, and almost succumb to option C. Enter Ruffino's, a humble little Italian Restaurant located in a strip mall dangerously close to the suburbs of Ahwatukee. \n\nSo we saunter up and politely wait our turn for the hostess to be free. \""Two. No, we didn't make reservations.\"" And the flibbertigibbet proceeds to seat two parties milling around us without even informing us whether dining there was a possibility. Again, she turns to us. \""Do you have an open table for two? No, we didn't make reservations.\"" Again, she proceeds to seat others. Lots and lots of others.\n\nOh no you did not just rouse the bitch from her slumber. The pursed lips, raised eyebrow and death stare begin to surface. Mr. Man senses the subtle change, \""Do you just want to go and find somewhere else to eat?\""\n\nA cold, calculating response with an edge sharp enough to cut the horrid poodle hair off the twit that's been snubbing us spews out. (I can't recall what it was exactly. The vitriol clouds memory, often with good reason.)\n\nThen our savior, a tux dressed waiter out of stage left, greets us with a smile and ushers us to a table for two in the bar area. The bitch circles three times before settling down for a snooze so Erica can enjoy a nice meal with Mr. Man.\n\nSince it was a busy holiday they only had three seating times and a truncated menu, but that just makes it easier for an indecisive gal like me to make up my mind. Mr. Man goes with his favorite, the Veal Marsala. I opt for the Veal Ruffino, prosciutto and mushrooms sauteed in a tarragon brandy cream sauce layered over veal medallions. Yes I eat poor caged baby cows. And I do it because they taste goooooood. My meal was perfection, with a side of al dente rigatoni in marinara and perfectly steamed petite julienne vegetables. The marsala wasn't as stellar, but I'm not the one that had to consume it, so to each their own. \n\nThe meal came with garlic bread, which was respectable, and a salad that was delish! Their house vinagrette was rockin'. We also decided to kick off the evening with a bottle of chardonnay that was chilled in one of them thingys that stands by your table. \n\nThere were balloons and streamers and live entertainment in the form of a super stellar, pitch perfect showman all tuxed out and belting out classics while playing the piano. Cutesy couples were even requesting songs and dancing with their sweeties. Aww. The sap in me just melts. See that puddle of goo at your feet? That's me. Don't step in it.\n\nThere was also a nice program they were running that night where they would take you home for a flat rate of 10 bucks within a 15 mile radius so you didn't ring in the New Year with a DUI. Now that's class.\n\nI don't know if I'd ever go back here again (leetle on the pricey side at 20-30 bucks for an entree) but if you're in the area and looking for a dining experience rather than straight calories, hit it up!"
2	"my husband and I ate here a few months back and really enjoyed the food. The service was excellent. I found all of the staff to be quiet friendly. \nIt is very expensive. For two people you will spend about $70, depending on what you get. My husband and I had two meals and a glass of wine each. \nI think as far as Italian food goes this is the best I have had so far in Phoenix."
2	"Homemade pasta cooked to order?  \nYES\n\nHomemade sauces cooked to order?\nYES\n\nExciting and different Italian entrees?\nYES\n\nNot-pretentious and delicious?\nYES!\n\nFood at this place blows my socks off.\nI very much enjoyed this place."
2	"I have been to Ruffino's for drinks a few times, but I cannot believe I waited so long before actually dining here!\n\nI had an INCREDIBLE dinner last night at Ruffino's - Escargot for an Appetizer, Cannelloni for Dinner...and all I can say is \""WOW.\"" My first bite of the Cannelloni was like a taste explosion! Very complex flavors. I've only had Escargot once before at Cafe Boa. I don't remember loving it - but I can say I'd definitely order it again now! It's served in a butter/garlic sauce at Ruffino's inside of mushroom caps. Excellent.\n\nI thought the prices were very affordable. It's obvious the pasta is hand made. The sauces are extremely fresh. You get what you pay for!\n\nIt truly is a sophisticated place. Who would guess by the location in a strip mall?? Fresh flowers on the table, great service, live singer on a Wed. night.\n\nClassic. All that was missing was Frank Sinatra sitting in the corner. But the live singer made up for that (on a Wednesday night even!)"
2	"I've eaten at Ruffino's since they opened, about 3 owners ago.  First of all expect to enter a time machine and go back to the old-style restaurant's where the tables are covered with linen and the staff are constantly moving through the room.\n\nI took a date there this spring, telling her that the outside isn't much to look at (in a strip mall between a shoe repair and a veterinarin), but when you open the door you find the place packed.  I had called ahead for a reservation, and was led immediately to the table.  \n\nAs I wrote above, the service is excellent and the food great (a little pricy, but if you want value go to Olive Garden).  I was telling my date about the Osso Bucco being my choice if I ever had to pick a last meal, when the server took the hint and brought us a small plate of pasta with the sauce.  You're not going to get that at O-G.\n\nSo when you want a great meal at a local hole in the wall, I highly recommend Ruffino's.  On Friday's, weekends and holiday's you should call ahead for a reservation.  Keep the kids at home so you can really enjoy the experience."
2	"This place is a hidden gem.\n\nLocated in an obsure strip mall... I took a date to this place and the dinner, the wine, the dessert... ALL TERRIFIC.\n\nThe atmosphere is 1980's... The Soprano's... Jersey Italian. \n\nGreat place to bring a date. Great place if you're hungry and you want a wonderful meal.\n\nAnd don't let the quiet exterior fool you. When we walked in... the bar area was packed and there was a nice mix and old and young dining in the dining area. \n\nTheir fresh out of the oven garlic bread was delicious and their pasta... awesome. \n\nGive this place a try. You won't be disappointed."
2	"This restaurant is a typical (and I mean typical in every sense of the word) American Italian restaurant.  Let's see:\n\n- Cheesy Italian music subtly playing in background - Check\n- Wood Paneling and faux crystal light fixtures, reminding you eerily of the 80's - Check\n- Pleasant but not overbearing waiters/waitresses in black-n-whites - Check\n- Salad and Garlic Bread with everything - Check\n\nNow, as to the food we ordered, the Bruschetta was nicely toasted, with a garlicy tomatoe mix on top - very nice.  Then came the salad, which is tossed table side - a nice touch.  However, the greens tasted like they were straight out of a bag.  No-one takes a free salad seriously any more.  This was followed with warm garlic bread - the french baguette they were using for this had been squashed and went cold very quickly.  Cold garlic bread that doesn't taste of garlic sounds like cold toast to me.\n\nOn to the main courses.  My companion and I both had \""signature dishes\"" - I had the Duck Ravioli, which was accompanied by a tomato cream sauce, and she had the Shrimp linguine, which was also pleasant.\n\nAll-in-all, this was a pleasant evening.  The food was reasonable, and the environment non-obtrusive.  The \""free\"" accompaniments brought the meal down a notch - get rid of the garlic bread and salad unless asked for (and when they are asked for - make them shine - it's not that hard), and you have a five-star place."
2	"We went to Ruffino's at the last minute for Happy Hour.  They were wonderful at accommodating our party of 7.  The service was incredible - so friendly and prompt.  They have a fabulous Happy Hour with great wine, drink and appetizer specials.  Their Seafood Martini is fabulous!  Will definitely be back."
1	"2.5 stars, maybe.  I hate to bag on a restaurant because I know restaurant owners work so hard, but this was a pretty bad experience.  I know they have live music, too, and that is a sign of class.\n\nFundamentally, the problem with this place can best be summed up by saying that it wouldn't surprise me if there isn't a single Italian involved in the running of this place.  If there is, they have gone so American it's hard to tell.  Think Pascal in \""Big NIght.\""\n\nWhen I showed up by myself at 7pm, I had not eaten lunch so I should have been pretty easy to please.  The restaurant was mostly empty, yet I was sat  at a small table right next to the only baby in the restaurant.  Really?  I probably didn't look Awhatukee chic, but I didn't look like a bum either.  And hey, it was Monday and my credit card is paid off.\n\nI was sat by the owner (I think).  He didn't take a drink order and then I waited a long time to get a menu or a drink.  I don't blame the server.  It was bad timing as she knew she had a meal for four being plated and a couple of credit cards to run.  The owner could have easily handled both the menu and my drink order.\n\nThen, they brought the garlic bread.  It was that soggy over-buttered, undercooked, nastiness you would never get in Italy or even a high-end Italian restaurant in the states.  (Think Fazoli's)  The greasiness probably started to take away my appetite which had been sky high when I arrived.  I would strongly recommend that Ruffino's ditch the garlic bread and go with nice Italian bread and small bowl of butter.\n\nSoon after, the entrees for the neighboring table arrived.  They didn't look like $25-30 entrees.  Even the osso bucco looked unappetizing..\n\nThen, they brought me a cup of brodo with tortellini.  The waitress warned me to be careful because it was super hot.  I would say it was just hot enough not to get sent back.  It was decent, but kind of puny for four bucks.  The bowl would have been seven and I was mostly trying it out of curiosity.  The broth was pretty good, but as it got colder it lost any magic it had.\n\nI also got a Campari and soda, which was a little light on Campari.  It didn't come with a fruit wedge of any type, which is pretty standard when an Italian is behind the bar.  So, I asked for an orange.  Unfortunately, because I was seated in the farthest corner from the door and the bar, I didn't get the orange until I was over halfway through the Campari and soda.  Maybe I'm off base here and I should asked for it explicitly.  Sorry, I'm not much of a drinker.\n\nThe salad was quite good.  They make it tableside which is nice because I got to pick my choice of elements.  The greens were excellent and the dressing was nice.  I think I got two portions even though I was by myself, which was great.  Unfortunately, there was a little too much cheese (or something) making it too heavy.  Still, not bad.\n\nThroughout the evening my water glass was empty, which is annoying when you're paying $20 minimum for an entree.  I'm not a stickler about this stuff, but when it happens 3-5 times at a place like this, it's not right.  My waitress was very nice and worked very hard.  One thing that sort of stuck with me was when I was discussing the menu, she said something like, \""They've been here 20 years, it's good.\""  I'm wondering if that was indicative of a place resting too much on its laurels.\n\nI got the Fettuccini Ruffino which was a sausage-based dish listed as one of seven signature dishes on the menu and strongly recommended by my server because it was \""simple\"" and tasty.  After a pretty dubious performance so far, I convinced myself that this entree was going to hit it out of the park and save the evening.  Instead, it was a total failure and I was actually forcing it down by the end.  It wasn't simple.  It was sloppy.\n\nThey cooked the life out of the fettuccini and the sauce looked like something Olive Garden would have invented, not like the sausage crumbles with oil, pasta and vegetables I am used to at high-end Italian joints.  The sausage was exactly like something you'd buy at Trader Joe's, which isn't bad, but it didn't seem homemade or special.  Honestly, if they had put the plate in front of me, my first reaction would have been to tell them they had brought it to the wrong table.   Maybe I was expecting the wrong the thing, but whatever the case, it didn't taste very good.\n\nAfterward, I went to Enzo's Cafe and Gelato for a cappuccino to make things right.  There was more Italian in that cappuccino than a whole meal at Ruffino's.  Now, I'm watching Tony Bourdain in Naples just to make up for the rest of the evening..\n\nI hope I can get another chance to go here and have them prove me wrong, but I won't do it on my dime.  There was just a little too much Olive Garden in Ruffino's to justify the prices."
1	"I have eaten at this restaurant a few times before and liked it. A nice neighborhood place. So, we thought to go here to celebrate my niece's graduation. We had a party of 10 and the service was terrible.  The servers didn't bring drinks or ask if we wanted anything other than our order. They were all in a back room doing something. And the food was not good, either. I had chicken piccata - yuck. It had a thickish cream sauce - like creamy soup. Not light and lemony like it should be. I do not think I would go back."
1	"This may very well be what passes for good Italian food in Phoenix, but Olive Garden is cheaper. \n\nThe staff is friendly. Don't confuse that with competent. But I suppose the old folks that come here aren't exactly picky.\n\nTacky interior, bland food that is overpriced, and service that moves at the speed of Tectonic Plates. Which would have been saved had the food been good. Sadly, no.\n\nSkip that bread too. It's soggy and stale. The table side salad service is just a distraction. The kitchen is in no hurry to serve up what can only be generously called Italian."
1	"Good location,average food, but too expensive. Drink service is slow. Entertainment is spotty. Should double the bar size and delete dining room"
2	"i went here the other night for the first time with a date. i am pretty blown away! i had a glass of the caramel road chardonnay.. which was AMAZING!! and i got the fettuccine Alfredo.. it was honestly the best fettuccine Alfredo i have ever had! they also have this table side salad service where they make the salad in front of you and ask what you want in it which was also superb. will be coming back here and telling friends and family about this great little treasure!! oh by the way our server was GREAT too. I forget his name (very bad with names). highly recommended!"
1	"Good location,average food, but too expensive. Drink service is slow. Entertainment is spotty. Should double the bar size and delete dining room. this place has been steadily going down hill. surprised they are still in business. was very good 20 yrs ago. Owners watch people like hawks, desperately waiting for food orders"
1	"Just dined there this evening, and we were fairly disappointed. The food was very nicely prepared, tasted just fine, however the service left a lot to be desired. And the worst thing was that both our dinners, and my coffee ended up at our table lukewarm. if you can't manage to bring items to the table hot, than the rest of this review begins to hardly matter. The waitress was snippy, not friendly in any discernible way. The water and coffee were very slow to be refilled, in fact everything was slow about the service. They brought out our entrees while our appetizer plates were still on the table...and they had been sitting there for some time! One of them never did get picked up. From here, I hardly feel the need to mention the screaming baby, the pretty Italian music that got cut off halfway through our meal, and the confusion/staff bickering that we encountered when we first arrived... but there you go. They told me they have been in business for 20 years, but they still can't seem to get the most basic components right. Overpriced, and not a good experience. Try someplace else."
1	"I am giving this restaurant 1 star, only because my entree was actually good. Otherwise, it would have been a zero star review. Everything there could use a lot of improvement. Upon arriving we were greeted by a hostess who seemed to be confused about where to seat us, although the restaurant was mostly unoccupied, with the exception of the small bar area. This led to her being bickered at by what ended up being our waitress. We were then seated by the manager with no menus. I went to the ladies room to wash my hands before our meal, where I was enjoying the lovely music.... just as it was abrubtly turned off. There was no music for the rest of our visit. When we finally got some menus (and bread upon request), we ordered some drinks. I ordered a rum and coke, and my date ordered a coffee. Don't let their happy hour advertising fool you! There is NO HAPPY HOUR at Ruffino's restaurant. Although they do have a happy hour in the small bar area, if you sit even 10 feet away from it, you do not get to enjoy the special drink prices. I was misled and ended up paying full price for a drink, that if ordered a few feet away would have been half price! My date's coffee came out lukewarm, and when our appetizers arrived I had wished I ordered something else. My dates salad was pretty tasty, but my tortellini en brodo soup was awful. It was some chicken bouillon water with overcooked pasta, that had no hint of the meat it had suggested existed in it. Our entrees arrived quite a while later, and our table still hadn't been bussed since the appetizers. Both of our entrees were pretty darn tasty, but both were only lukewarm again. Not hot at all. Then there was a baby screaming with no music playing to distract me from the wailing infant. The waitress was snippy and seemed to be in a bad mood. And even with a lady following the waitress around for training, couldn't seem to bring out a box for my food and a requested cup of coffee. The service was just slow and almost snotty. So, I really wouldn't recommend it. It is too overpriced for a place with a hit and miss menu and very poor service.\nAlso, I ordered the Chicken Florentine, which is supposedly a stuffed chicken breast. But, it was actually only just topped with the ingredients listed. It also doesn't come with a knife, so I had to attempt cutting it up with a butter knife. Still pretty good, especially after I took it home and made it hot."
2	"Have never had a bad meal here in the 4 times I've been.  We usually sit in the bar.  I live just down the street and having a good local italian place is great.  The mussels with red sauce and bread is excellent.   The drinks are good and the wine selection is more than adequate.  Old school interior the way I like it.   The servers are attentive and on the nights I've been here, attractive.   Live entertainment on fridays and saturdays is a bonus.   Not cheap but the food is worth it."
2	"My mom went to Ruffino's and thought it was really good so we decided to give this place a shot. When you first walk in there a small bar that looks a little cramped but the dining room is pretty big. Nothing really stood out with the decor. \n\nAnyways, we started off with fried calamari and it was a huge appetizer. The batter on the calamari was very light and cooked just right. I thought it was really good. Also, they gave us little pieces of garlic bread. Outstanding. Really good. Everyone gobbled it up so we had to get another basket. \n\nSo each meal comes with soup or salad. I got the salad and I thought it was really big dinner salad it had mixed greens with cucumber, mushrooms, and tomatoes. The salad dressing was great. Not overpowering because at some places the vinegar is a little too much. Not here. Really good. \n\nI had the Seafood Ruffino. It had shrimp, scallops, muscles, and clams over a bed to pasta with a red sauce. I thought it was pretty good. I thought the red sauce could have tasted a little better. It had a good taste but not great. My wife had the chicken primavera. Chicken was moist and she enjoyed it. Hugh dish. \n\nTo end our meal was tried the chocolate cake and cheese cake. I thought they were good. Not great. I'm used to these Italian restaurant having great deserts.  \n\nThe service was top notch. Server took care of us and he was always checking on us during each portion of our meal (appetizer, salad, entree, and desert). Our glasses were filled on a regular basis. The only thing is the server did his job very good but didn't feel like he had personality. Very business like. Seemed like all the servers were like that. \n\nSo really good service, good food, and huge portions. Not a bad place. We'll see if we can make it back to this place."
1	"Been here several times.  Food is generally good, happy hour prices could be good if they know how to ring you up.  Depending on who waits on you, you will be charged for drinks you didn't order and the prices will be inconsistent on the check for what you actually order.  3 different prices for the same brand of beer.  I believe this is padding to compensate for the fledgling revenues and dwindling crowd.  Sit at the bar as the service is better.  Careful when you bring up the inconsistencies on the tab as the owner is defensive and condescending.  They should practice consistency.  Long time regulars complain about the shell of this establishment from whatnot was, but come here for convenience.  If you really have a choice, go to Garage across the street.  Good service and act like they appreciate your business."
2	"Very tasty Italian food.  I enjoyed the calamari and stuffed canneloni.  Place is dimly lit and a little dated but nice and intimate. Servers were cordial but not overly attentive.  Pricey, which reflects the cloth tablecloths and napkins."
2	"Very Good! Nice people, and good food. Always recommend this place.  Buon appetito!"
2	"Don't let the strip mall location fool you.  The food is excellent, best lasagna I've ever had.  Garlic bread was only disappointment, would be better with fresh sour dough.  Excellent fish entrees and desserts.  Creme brul\u00e9 is terrific.  Good wine selection.  Great neighborhood place."
2	"Amazing! Delicious! It was our first time here and we were very impressed! We came here for our anniversary & had an amazing dinner!    Everything we had was delicious and the staff was exceptional! Will definitely be back! Don't be fooled by the outside or the location- the inside is superb!"
2	"Wonderful food, people, excellent dining.  Exquisite Lobster Bisque!"
2	"Favorite vendor business dinner spot near my work. Someone wants me to sell their products? Meet me at Ruffinos"
1	"I am very disappointed with Ruffino. We used to come in every month or two. However, we had a bad experience on Mother's Day and I wrote a note to the management and still haven't received a response. The service was beyond terrible that day and the place was packed because of a huge first communion party. There was a table of 10 unsupervised children right by us that were loud. The adults were sitting a few tables away and basically ignored them until it came time to serve cake. We asked the manager to do something and were ignored. There were issues with our order, slow service and an unpleasant experience. This saddens me because they have great food, but the service and execution just isn't there. We haven't been back since Mother's Day, and at this point I don't know if we will return because I don't feel like a valued customer. Management should take concerns raised by customers seriously and act on them, or at the very least respond to an email."
1	"I haven't been to a Wendy's in a very long time. I used to love going to Wendy's as a kid.\n\nMy visit via the drive-thru was friendly enough. Nice staff member at the window. Fast service.\n\nThe food however. Ugh. First off I ordered a diet Coke and got a regular Coke. The burger was decent but there are better burgers at other fast-food restaurants now. The fries must have been sitting around for a while. They weren't very hot and were pretty soft.\n\nNot sure I have a reason to go back again after this experience. I didn't go back and complain since I was on my way home and tired and didn't feel like wasting my time. I just through out the soda and most of the fries."
1	"I love pizza and this is not bad but overrated to me.\n\nMy friend from Boston she loves this pie because they cut it into squares and it reminds her of pie from a chain back in Beantown.\n\nI think it is just ok.  Kind of bland, a little pricey.  Good for out here I guess, but not really that good."
2	"I tried Nello's for the first time today and I was impressed. I love the personal pan size pizzas because I was able to have my tomatoes, onions, garlic, and basil on mine while my boyfriend has plain pepperoni. The pizzas were tasty and the toppings were very fresh. The employees that helped were so friendly and very personable! I noticed they have a happy hour so I will definitely go back to try that!"
1	"Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n5 Food\n7 Service\n7 Atmosphere\n6 Value\n\nUpon first walking in it smelled like a Mr. Gatti's.  Now, I love Mr. Gatti's (do any even still exist?), so that's not an insult, except that that smell means to me that I should be getting big food for little money, and that wasn't the case.\n\nI wasn't even expecting that much, and this place failed.  The server was nice enough and well timed though he didn't ask if we'd ever been there before to offer some info.\n\nThen the food came out.  With the exception of a hum-drum tomato sauce on our veggie \""thinbread\"" pizza, the flavors were excellent.  The house dressing on the salad was great, and my European \""deepdish\"" (no tomato sauce) tasted superb.  But let me backup - it's not a deepdish.  AT ALL.  It's a normal pizza with bread walls.  And the thincrust wasn't a thincrust either!!  They were both just normal pizzas.  EPIC FAIL.  Deepdish should require a fork and a knife.  I used my hands, easily.  Therefore I received half the food I was expecting.\n\nOn the upside, they offer half-pitchers of Oak Creek beers, which is a big win.  That and the flavors on my European were all that stood between this place and one less star.  The only people that can possibly rate this place well have never had a real thincrust or deepdish pizza."
2	"I have been visiting this location for years. At least since 1996 or so. Anyways, this restaurant really does seem to get better with age! The salads are awesome, and large enough to split among a group.\n\nThe pizza is outstanding, especially the thin crust specials.\n\nAnd they have Hop Knot (from four peaks) on tap.\n\nWhat more do you need!"
2	"Nello's is just down the street from us, so it has been a family favorite for years.  We always enjoy a meal here!  Our family hasn't chosen as to which type of pizza we prefer, Chicago, New York, California, etc.  We know we like fresh ingredients, crispy crust, lots of cheese and cold drinks. You definitely get all that and great service at Nello's.\n\nFresh pizza does take a while longer to prepare than chain par-baked dough.  The salads are huge and are full of flavor.  An there's always a favorite on tap.  We enjoyed the Four Peaks Peach Ale.\n\nNello's just added a Bambino's Menu, fantastic now they have some great kid's size meals for the little ones to enjoy too!"
2	"Good food - fresh and interesting local market pizzas.  Great beer selection."
2	"Nello's is pretty darn wonderful - more than a strict sauce slicked pie joint in that some of their creations are pushing the culinary envelope.  I've actually Googled some of their specialty toppings at the table to figure out what they are, the cheeses so specific to regions around the world that you'll want to learn more on why they are notable.\n\nOriginal crust is thick and buttery, yielding heavy toppings and tender strands of mozzarella.  I'm a big fan of the Schriers pepperoni on a margherita pizza, laden with fresh garlic and torn basil.  Salads are hearty and plentiful, with a killer Spinach Salad (crisp bacon, egg, crunchy radishes and grape tomatoes) and White Balsamic Dressing.\n\nWaitstaff at this location are bustling while still managing to be endearing.  Service can get spotty on weekends when the place crowds a bit, but on two separate occasions where mistakes were made, the manager corrected both immediately with not only no charges for the items but still sending the ordered items.  We've actually left with two pizzas in hand - totally unasked for but very appreciated.\n\nI don't really compare the pizza here to other thin-crust pies - it's so specific of a taste, it's almost its own thing.  That all being said, it's such a yummy experience, if you don't pigeonhole the pizza, you are in for a treat."
2	"I love Nello's. \n\nI'd like to write something prettier, something poetic. It's one of my favorite pizza places, and it deserves a little wordsmithery. But I'm too sated on deep-dish deliciousness to muster up my usual silver-tongued sweetness.\n\nIf you like Chicago-style pizza (and I do) made fresh with quality ingredients in generous portions, try Nello's.  Their Hawaiian pizza is excellent. Any of their pizzas are, really. \n\nOr you could smear some tomato paste and plasticky cheese on a piece of charred cardboard and call it \""pizza\"". It works for Domino's, after all."
2	"Met a group of people...great craft beer selection.. ordered Old World Salad w/House Dressing, excellent.. enough to feed 2-4 people..\nthen the Murphy pizza.. applewood smoked bacon and onions w/the thin crust, wood fired. This is an awesome pizza. The rest of the group got various  pizzas and loved everything! Our waitress was great, and took good care of us.."
2	"If I could have their salad forever my life would be complete. It has chickpeas, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, olives, mushrooms, cucumber, feta and the most amazing house dressing....for months I went here thinking the Classic Euro pizza was the end all be all but that salad changed my world. \n\nSide note: don't sit at those little tables by the bar, it really ruins the experience. \n\nSlight annoyance, there are coupons for Nello's in the entertainment book, but they wont work at this location."
1	"Normally Nello's to-go lunch is great - not today!   My co-worker found a worm in her half turkey club sandwich!     We called and talked to Shea the manager who condescendingly said that although Nello's washes their lettuce they can't help that a worm won't get off the lettuce.   Now we know the little green worm is quite little, but we are particular that our protein intake not be alive and moving.   With all the lunch providers in Ahwatukee and with the holiday season you would think Nello's may have been apologetic and even a little generous.   We weren't expecting our entire $40 ticket to be comped, but when we asked if I could receive some compensation, Shea responded by saying they can replace the half sandwich/salad if my co-worker came back in that day.   Not even an apology and a $10 gift card.  I guess the Ahwatukee Nello's has a manager who doesn't really believe in a high level of customer service.   I wouldn't have posted this if she would have been a bit kinder in her tone and generous by only a few more dollars.   It really is all about how people are treated - I hope Shea's staff is treated better than we were."
2	"Stopped in for an lunch meeting. Staff was very nice to us .restrooms were clean . In fact it was a nice clean restaurant . Worth going out of you're way for .."
1	"Very Bland, Poor Tasting Pizza! \nDoes NOT live up to the Hype!!!! \n\n\nThis was the first and probably last visit to Nellos. This pizza does not live up to all the hype here on Yelp. I ordered a pizza with black olives and beef. I had the \""original\"" crust. The crust was thick, chewy and tasteless. It looked as thought it was put on a conveyer oven, not woodfired. After the second slice the crust became too hard, bland and chewy to even eat, like cardboard. It was a very bad product. The sauce was very bland, and it looked very much like a frozen pizza, except some frozen pizzas are better. I really don't understand the pizza market in Phoenix.\n I grew up in on authentic Italian pizza and cuisine, albeit here in Phoenix everyone seems to sing high praises to very bad pizzas. This pizza does not even compare to a good Pizza. I just think that the folks here in Phoenix haven't tasted a real pizza, If they travel back East and try the pizza then they would know what real Pizza Pie is supposed to taste like.  For now if I want a good Pizza Pie, I'll just have to make it my self.\n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone.\n\nOne Star for the Food, One Star for the Service (Service was good, Pizza Bad)"
2	"I live in San Diego, but this place is always my first stop on my way home from the airport.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and buy a bottle of salad dressing to go.  It is good on everything."
2	"I have this taste in my mouth of what a margherita pizza should taste like.  I've been in search of it for years. Sadly, this place did not measure up to what I had in mind but it was still delicious pizza.  Everything taste fresh, the sauce, the dough, the toppings, yum!  \n\nI've been here twice, once for lunch and another time for a takeout order.  Everything went smoothly on the take out order, while I waited I got to see the kitchen staff in action, they really work hard!  When I came in for a sit down meal, the food and service were great.  It did take a long time to get our food though so I don't recommend coming here for lunch if you're on a time crunch.  They get very busy."
2	"This is one of my favorite places to eat Lunch. Attentive staff, Great Salads and also a individual sized Pizza with salad and drink....great food at a really good price."
2	"After many visits our favs are: old world salad and classic european pizza.  Also love the pastas.  Sandwiches are tasty as well."
2	"It's was really good! We got the Margarita Pizza, but instead of the thin crust, we got the thick regular one. It was super good. My sister also go the baked Zetti, and a house salad. Also super good."
2	"Great gluten free pizza options and very attentive service.  We'll be back!"
2	"Always a great place to come for good food and some ambiance. Pizza is good, even without getting the usual meat style (I'm not a vegetarian at all) wait times can be long especially with a lot if other places nearby opening up."
1	"Pretty much done with Nello's Ahwatukee...it is now The Parlor - Part II wannabe\n\nThey have killed what used to be really good pizza - NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE there can make a pizza like George used to.\n\nWhat a shame and a perfectly good wood-burning pizza oven being sadly misused.\n\nFlorencia is much better; even Grimaldi's is better - and carryout from Rosati's is WAY better!"
2	"The food here is excellent, from Pizza to Pasta, to Great salads!! great beer selection, excellent atmosphere, staff is fun and personable. If you're looking for New York style pizza fire grilled, this is your place!!"
2	"I love this place. Antipasto salad and a glass of red wine is my favorite meal. Everything from the pizza, salads and sandwiches are amazing. I'm the biggest Arnold Palmer drink fan and this place just knows how to serve it. The staff is always friendly and will go above to make sure your visit is great. Out of the 500+ restaurants in Phoenix, Nello's is my favorite. I call it, \""The Italian mother I never had restaurant.\"" They are only open until 10pm so make sure you arrive early in the evening. If you want to continue drinking after dinner, Zipps is right next door!"
2	"Still a five star place in my opinion. Great service, draft beer, salads and flat crust pizza.\n\nThe salmon arugula salad is awesome and the market thin crust usually is as well.\n\nVery accommodating for children too!"
1	"I really expected to give Nellos a good review but its not that great, not sure if they were in a hurry when they made our pizza but it was lacking in a descent quantity of ingredients we ordered on it we ordered a large pizza with mushrooms, onions, green peppers and pepperoni. One piece out of the whole pizza seamed adequately filled with ingredients. Way to much crust. May come back may not. The bottled beer was $3 also sadly not impressed."
2	"I've lived in Phoenix for a year and have yet to find a pizza place worth talking about (I'm from Chicago...nothing compares).  I decided to give this place a try last night.  It was delicious!  I loved the atmosphere...had an upscale-ish d\u00e9cor but not too yuppie to make you feel uncomfortable for wearing jeans (our server had on a black tee shirt and a baseball cap.  The server was very personable, we never had empty drinks, and knew his way around the menu, which was great, as we had never been there before.  We got the Caprese for an app, and since my bf and I have opposite tastes in pizza, we each ordered our own so we could get what we wanted and have leftovers.  We could tell it was starting to get really busy, and a line was forming out the door, but the server made sure to stop by often, and not make us feel rushed as we sat for a few minutes finishing our beers.  Their ingredients were fresh and more than you can get at most pizza places (an awesome variety of cheeses to choose from, and everything from regular veggies to shrimp or salmon!).  For 2 people our bill ran just under $60, which was totally reasonable for an app, drinks, and 2 pizzas.  I will definitely be returning and recommending to my friends!"
1	"The food isnt hot. How can they prevent bacteria from growing. T he inside smelled terrible"
1	"Well they keep bragging about how good their stuff is but it still tastes like sh*t. It is still worse than Pizza Hut and Papa Johns which is pretty bad because they are both crap too. It tastes like the same old crappy Dominos with extra salt and 10 cents worth of herbs added on and some garlic goop smeared on the crust. I'm not sure if it's any better, it's just different. That's about what I expected, but I'm still pissed. Also on my box it said \""the road to enlightenment is paved with sliced italian sausage\"" and my inner Kwai Chang felt repulsed. \""For all life is precious nor can any be replaced.\"" A road of meat to enlightenment?! F- them. \n0 stars!"
1	"This store lost a customer. After the manager disrespected my role as customer I no longer will be ordering from this particular store."
2	"Dominos has gotten really good in the last few years. \n\nYou're saying, \""Five stars? For Dominos? C'mon.\"" \n\nNo, you come on. Their pizza's good, it's fast, it's affordable, and their customer service is spectacular. Is it Spinato's or NYPD? No, but Spinato's not open late, they're way more expensive, and they don't have an awesome online ordering system.\n\nFor economy pizza delivery, it's basically the Hut vs Dominos vs Papa John's. Out of those three, my favorite is the big D."
1	"well, first off they lied to us about their special and told us we could only get one topping per pizza when clearly advertised on the window was two topping.  While I'm sure this wasn't out of malice, just negligence, it was annoying.  My black olives prefer to be accompanied by mushrooms.  Secondly, their crust is the wonder bread equivalent of pizza dough.  Soft, airy and no chewiness at all.  I think we will stick with Little Caesars from now on when we want cheap pizzas."
2	"This is my go-to place for dinner when I'm pressed for time or just don't really feel like cooking. My family really likes their garlic sauce to dip their pizza in. The downside is that each sauce is .75 cents each. They deliver! That saves me so much time, there is a two dollar charge for that. Tip the driver because that doesn't go towards their tip!"
1	"yeah, this is the place where pseudo sushi afficienandos go to feel like their really exotic food experts. if it's got cream cheese in it, it ain't sushi, and this place has cc is just about every roll.\n\nhappy hour is LOUD in the bar. not fun loud, but \""let's crank the bad early 90s alt rock and top 40 emo rock as loud as possible\"" seemingly as catch all for the only demographics who will like this place- early 20s and late 40s and 50s who want to seem like they still know how to get down with the younger generation.\n\nbecause it's ahwatukee (a \""sleepy bedroom\"" community that is pretty affluent all in all and likes to be reminded), the crowd can be obnoxious, even more than this bar already is.\n\nagain, i recommend it as a place to go and be rowdy, not to eat great sushi."
2	"The atmosphere in RA is a bit pretentious, fake and noisy. But I actually like the place. I enjoy sitting on the patio, having a few happy hour asahi's and maybe having a sake bomber or two. I only do this when the weather is nice, and try to avoid friday's or saturday's. \n\nAs far as the food, I have eaten at several sushi places throughout the country and they all taste a bit fishy to me. When I get sushi I actually like it to be a bit bland. I sampled some of the more exotic stuff, and it wasn't for me.\n\nSo, for not being a sushi aficionado, by avoiding the crowded times and coming to RA's during happy hour times (7-10 i think?) I actually enjoy it!"
1	"Its a dump. Mind you - a very nicely decorated dump. If you wish to hang out and yell over music with out much care what goes in your mouth then this place is for you. If you care about your food you should get in your car and go elsewhere, as this is not a place for Sushi/Rolls lovers. Its mediocre at the very best. Bleah. \n\n\""I dunt like\""\nEugene"
1	"This bar is based more on looks rather than authenticity of Sushi. Not that I have a problem with promoting ambiance, but I'm more about authenticity and dive places. Additionally the service was rather shoddy and IMHO rather racist. There was definitely a perceptible difference in  service to people of the brown leaning as compared to the paler people. I've been told that's a Phoenix mentality ( but I still thinks it's absolutely wrong).\n\nAs for  the sushi well the gaari was bitter ( a good sign that the place is unauthentic) and the slices of fish (which I ordered, tuna and salmon ) were too thick ( on the maki) and in the rolls too skimpy. Shushi doesn't have too many variables to play around  with so the way to determine its goodness is based on these parameters (also on the taste/texture of the rice). The lighting was too dim for a raw meat food joint. \n\nThe  servers were attractive though (again a sign that what they are selling isn't food)"
2	"I have always heard bad things about Ra so I never wanted to make it a place to dine for sushi... I do think that most negative comments were referring to the location in Scottsdale if that makes any difference.  So what brought me to Ra was a team dinner with my coworkers.  The drinks I had were a little sweet than I usually like, but still good.  We were sat right away and the service was attentive... everything I had sushi wise was very good.  I enjoyed this much more than what I had at Kobe Japanese Steakhouse & Tepan & Sushi.  I would agree with other reviewers that the music is really loud and kind of out of place for a sushi restaurant.  In fact when we first arrived the music was at a normal level and then at some point they really cranked it up so then you kind of had to shout at the people in your party.  Other than that I really enjoyed the sushi and would come back for lunch since my office is close."
1	"Gave Ra two chances.  Still do not like the atmosphere, nor the food.  What's with the loud music?  Perhaps it's management hoping that I won't notice how awful the food is by painfully triggering my eardrums.  \n\nThe noodle soup, the title of which goes something like... $14 bowl of soup (I don't know, it was so noisy, I couldn't think!) was TERRIBLE.  I really can't expound on why I found it disgusting.  All I remember as I tasted the broth and noodles was a flashback of Warner Bros. cartoons where a character (was it Bugs Bunny?) was shoveling paper money into a burning fireplace.  Total waste of money.  Mom didn't like the soup, as well.  \n\nA coworker of mine and I met here for happy hour and tried many apps, which I do admit were nicely priced.  The low prices aren't enough to get me to return, however.  The one plate I remember liking, so much so that I ordered it twice (we were very hungry) was made of tofu.  I even wrote it down and asked for it at my favorite sushi resto, but they didn't know what it could be, much less replicate it.  Since I'm not much of a drinker, I cannot discuss happy hour drink specials as I only drink water- I rarely order alcohol because I prefer to eat my calories.\n\n\nSayona-Ra!"
1	"i've been to Ra a few times in Arizona and California. the chain is generally located in major strip malls so it's one of those places i repeatedly stumble on while shopping or trying to kill time before a late movie. \n\ni think Ra wants to be known as a late night hot spot as opposed to a place you can find good sushi. there's always a great patio to socialize and people watch. the service is slow and confusing because you seem to end up with about 2 or 3 different people waiting on you. the last time i was here, waitress #2 poured our sake to the point where it overflowed. unless licking sake off the table is an ancient Japanese tradition i don't know about, that's pretty crap service. as for the sushi, it doesn't stand out at all. maybe the music made it so i couldn't taste my food. yeah, it's loud to the point where both your eardrums and your taste buds are numb.\n\nlike everyone else says, go for the Happy Hour and hanging out. but take only those friends who have perfect hearing and really loud voices."
1	"Delirious from hunger and unable to think straight I let my daughter talk me into the worst decision I've made in quite sometime. \n\nWe ordered a Tempura & California Roll Lunch Combo plus a tootsy maki and a tuna avocado roll rolled in toasted sesame seeds. \n\nThe tempura arrived, everything was barely crisp, a tad greasy but otherwise somewhat edible. \n\nWhen we got our sushi rolls it was apparent with one look that they were total crap, however, starving as we were we decided to carry on and eat. \n\nTootsy Maki= DooDoo Kaki! \n\nDon't be fooled by the long wait, they are not making these fresh to order. \nThis was definitely a roll that was prepped and pre-rolled last night! \nThe seaweed was chewy and slimy, the dried up rice almost broke my tooth and the crab mixture was like eating mayo that sat out over night. \n\nMy Tuna and Avocado roll which I asked specifically to be rolled in TOASTED SESAME SEEDS, was no better with it's also chewy seaweed and RAW Sesame Seeds, I didn't order a \ndamn big mac. WTF! \n\nThe California roll that arrived lastly with the salad was the same kind of pre-rolled crap. We ended up leaving it. \n\nUnfortunately I had to pay for this shit, but made sure to thank the sushi guys for the worst sushi I've ever eaten and let them know that I knew they  had served us pre-rolled crap, and of course they had nothing to say but \""have a nice day\""! \n\n*vomits*"
1	"Ra is a great place to go if you're looking for a party-atmosphere to hang out with friends and have some sake. But be warned, if you're in the mood for authentic and fresh sushi and a relaxing atmosphere, this is not the place.\n\nThe patio, during the cooler months, is quieter and more enjoyable (and is a decent place to people-watch on weekend nights). They have a great bar if you're looking to socialize and have a few cocktails during happy hour. \n\nThe special rolls are good. I love their Ultimate Shrimp Tempura roll and their Ahi Tuna is good. However, the seafood is not as fresh as it could be. The prices are a bit expensive for only receiving decent sushi. \n\nWhen you're traveling and don't know any local sushi joints, Ra is a reliable chain to go to."
2	"There are RA sushi locations in Houston, I don't care for them.  Bad service for overpriced, undeserved food.  Well, I had a to spend the night in Phoenix and hungry.  There were only two restaurants opened, Applebee's and RA.  Hmm...which to choose...I don't like either.  My friend suggested RA since he likes it in Houston.  Wow!  It was fun!!  The inexpensive sake bombs and yummy sushi.  When you haven't eaten all day and your first meal starts at 11 pm...it was heavenly!!  The bartender was super awesome!!"
2	"Fab happy hour.... make dinner out of it! 4 rolls , 2 salads & a lobster wonton app with a divine sauce to go with... all about $40... including a couple drinks.. \nYellow tail roll was my least fav.. just had a weird taste.. and I cant do sushi with a taste that isnt fresh... umm sorry not worth it.. but everything else was right on...so I didnt send back... \nWaiter kind of complacent.. I hate my salads to come seconds before my other choices.. \nDecor I adore!"
1	"Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):\n6 Food\n7 Service\n8 Atmosphere\n4 Value"
1	"Good sushi, great service. The loud rock music and night club atmosphere was a little too much. Went on a Thursday night and was told it was really laid back. I'd avoid the place on the weekends if you are looking for a quiet relaxing dinner.   The sushi was just okay.  For the price you pay, I'd expect excellent.   A little disappointed."
1	"Pretty good happy hour. Not very authentic sushi. I hate people who think the can say they \""LOVE RA\"" but the only thing they get are the California rolls. If you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi- stay away. Fun atmosphere, pretty good service, cheap happy hour, but I've def had better sushi."
1	"If you have to feel like you're looking cool when you eat your sushi, this must be your place. I say that because it's always crowded and I fail to see the allure.\n\nIf you want sushi, there are better places nearby. If you want to go out and party, there are better places nearby. If you want to go out and party while eating sushi, you come here! \n\nThe sushi menu is incredibly gimmicky. Be prepared to hunt for their \""dictionary\"" so you can see what you're ordering. The happy hour deals are decent- I like both the Viva Las Vegas and Tootsy Maki rolls, but they just barely resemble sushi. Aside from the sushi, my fiance always orders the Chicken Katsu and enjoys it (particularly the wasabi mashed potatoes), but that's the only thing he orders at any Japanese restaurant. \n\nThere's always loud music blaring and after about 5, drunk girls in the bathroom. I can tolerate this place when someone else wants to go, but see no reason to eat here on my own accord."
1	"It'd actually been a while since I'd been to a Ra that wasn't for drinks on a Sunday happy hour. \n\nI was in the area with my boyfriend and we always go to this shopping center for the yogurt and we always pass Ra. I guess I couldn't remember just WHY I block Ra out of my mind until it slipped and I decided to give it another shot.\n\nBad idea.\n\nIt was a very very slow lunch, so when we walked in we were surprised to see no one at the host stand. We waited for a few minutes and finally a manager appeared to seat us. Our server appeared shortly after we were sat. I don't even remember her name, but she wasn't bad at all. She was probably the best thing about the whole experience - but that's not saying much.\n\nAnyway, my boyfriend ordered the beef teriyaki lunch but he wasn't a huge fan. I didn't try it so I can't say much else about it. I ordered freshwater eel nigiri - hard to mess up, spicy tuna roll - also hard to mess up, but it was also nothing special - and a softshell crab roll. I was definitely not a fan. The roll had too many other things in it that contradicted the crab - I ended up taking out the carrots and asparagus - too hard to put in a sushi roll! I was so put off by the roll that I didn't even finish it. It was a pretty expensive roll that should have just been kept simple like all other sushi places. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the banana maki. Again, it was nothing too special. Overall, I wasn't impressed and was reminded why I stayed away from Ra. I think they try too hard to make different and unique rolls that it ruins the flavor of it. I'll only go back to Ra MAYBE for the Sunday happy hours, if ever."
1	"Okay...I'm gonna keep saying this until you get it in your head!  You looking for sushi?  Why are you coming here??  Yes, I know it says RA \""Sushi\"" - it also says \""Bar\"" -- come for the drinks and atmosphere.  Really the sushi is not gonna blow any minds anytime soon.  Their reverse happy hour is always a delight since prices drop and the drinks keep flowing :)  Stay thirsty my friends!"
2	"Always enjoy our visits to RA. Our party of six arrived early afternoon. The restaurant was fairly slow,  we were seated quickly and greeted very friendly by Tiffany. \n\nWe ordered edamame, steamed and RA chips and salsa (tuna tartar with salsa and avocado served with wonton chips). \n\nWe were unsure of what to drink and Tiffany recommended White Sake Sangria. What a great recommendation!\n\nOur group shared udon noodles, Las Vegas roll, crispy tuna roll and two California rolls for the kids. \n\nWe really enjoy the atmosphere and grooving music to dance to with the kids!  Each meal is really fun because we mix it up and don't go in with any preconceived notions and our kids love it."
1	"RA is the worst place to go for sushi. They are owned by the Benihana corporation... so that should explain everything. RA is the Samauri Sam's for sushi. Test kitchen prepped with a marketing team to sell food based on quirky names for different rolls.\n\nThis RA is located in a shopping complex next to a movie theater. They have a decent bar and a great happy hour drink menu. That's about it. Don't eat there. Their fish doesn't taste very fresh and their rolls... well, they come out looking so fancy. But that's it. Just a pretty face. \n\nPrices are a little steep considering they serve 2nd rate sushi. You can find fresher tastier rolls at Safeways."
2	"We sat at the sushi bar and had a great time! Benjamin, our sushi chef, he really pampered us!  He even enticed our 8 year old to give eel, octopus and snow crab.  She loved them all, so no more just California Rolls for her!  Thanks Benjamin!"
2	"Cool and hip place. Black, red, and wood always seems to make a place cool. I started out with a spicy tuna roll. I know, not exactly going out on the edge, but still a good call. So tasty!\nThen, I went with the spicy chicken teriyaki udon. This was recommended by my server who I didn't call darlin'. Sometimes you've got to trust your server. Mine made a great call tonight. The ingredients look and taste very fresh, and are in good proportions to one another. The teriyaki sauce wasn't overbearing or salty. I've got to say that I enjoyed every bite. I couldn't finish it, but enjoyed every bite."
2	"We normally hit Ra Sushi for after-school snack-happy hour, but not today!  Don't tell the kids!\n\nWe were greeted quickly and seated at our booth. Kat was our server and she was very attentive and extremely polite. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We love our visits to Ra!"
1	"Gilbert location is nicely decorated.  I like to sit outside on the patio during the nice weather because it's too loud inside.  The hostess was terrible - not inviting at all! - but our waitress was awesome.  The food is so-so.  It's hard to screw up miso soup, edamame and veggie rolls.  But the veggie tempura was terrible!  Dripping in oil and the dipping sauce was tasteless - or maybe overpowered by the taste of the oil.  There are DEFINITELY better sushi places but the prices are reasonable.  It's chain, keep your expectations low."
1	"I'm not usually the biggest fan of Ra to begin with but we go there every now and then for Happy hour for sushi.  We decided to go to the Awhatukee location this time instead of Tempe.  Parking is usually crazy because they share it with a movie theater and other businesses. \n\nWe were seated and ordered our drinks and all was well.  We ordered our food and we ordered 3 rolls.  It took them 45 minutes to bring out our rolls when we were starving.  They never take that long and it was just unacceptable.  Every time we asked our server to bring us something we knew it was going to take him 10 minutes to come back with it.  Our daughter was waiting for her cheater chopsticks so she could eat with us, and that took forever. Same with our bill etc. It was a pain in the ass.  Their rolls are pretty mediocre anyway.  They are never rolled tightly and they are tiny.  I don't think we will be visiting a chain like this in a while.  We will stick to a mom and pop sushi restaurant."
1	"Ra Ra Sis Boom Blah.. Ive tried so many times to eat here and like it since there aren't  really any other sushi restaurants nearby.  Its just not happening. Sure they have a great happy hour prices, but I don't think I should have to fish lemon seeds out of my sake bottle, or have little nats swimming around in my soy sauce. The sushi wasn't very fresh at all. This would be a great place to go if you've never eaten sushi before, so then you'd have nothing to compare it to."
1	"I've never been a huge fan of RA but I decided to give them one last chance tonight, and it will be my last. The service was absolutely terrible and the food was mediocre at best. The waiter was rude and we were halfway done with our meal before he brought out our drinks. This was yet another bad experience at RA sushi and it will be my last."
1	"Went to Phoenix for my buddy's Rock and Roll Marathon, and on the day we were heading back to LA we decided to grab some sushi since it seemed to be on everyone's mind. Found that there was a RA sushi bar right near the place we were staying at, and so what I thought was going to be a decent sushi place; since we have one back in CA ended up turning into a horrible experience. To be honest the only good thing I remember about this place was the hot waitress and the green tea...lol...I mean the service took forever (which btw it was around 3 pm and no one was in the restaurant), so either we had some beginner sushi chef learning the ropes or they just decided to take there sweet ass time. If it weren't for the eye candy and the green tea I wouldn't be able to give it any stars, but I decided to be nice and at least give them a star for effort. Have fun for whoever decides to try out this place. Never going back that's for sure. =P"
2	"My husband and I always keep coming back! We're all about exploring different sushi places, but each time I find myself comparing it to RA and having a \""Aw MAN!\"" moment, just wishing their sushi was as good as RA's. We usually go for Happy Hour in the afternoon for better prices on rolls. They increased their Happy Hour prices a while ago, but apparently that doesn't matter because I keep coming back because it's worth it! Also, I have to say that almost all of the servers are covered in tattoos, and that...is kick ass!"
2	"Our Sunday night plans turned out lamer than expected, and RA's reverse happy hour saved the evening! All dressed up on a Sunday evening with nowhere special to go? Ra will do!\n\nSunday nights they 'transform' the bar in to the 'Flying Fish Lounge.' A DJ sets up right around 8pm in the corner of the bar and the beats stay bumping til close. Though the beats are nothing out of this world, it just spice up the bar area, but doesn't cause too much commotion in the restaurant area...\n\nDrinks & food at RA are overpriced regularly, but as mentioned, for HH, you can't complain. The prices range from $2-$7 for both drinks & sushi specials. Big rolls like the amazing Las Vegas Roll & probably the shrimp tempura are $7, basic rolls like spicy tuna are $4, & I think the nigri is $3.. Hot sake - $1, Big Kirin beers are only like $3, & their mix drinks range, but are never that impressive.\n\nThat night I ordered two rolls (the toosty maki is always a winner if you like eel sauce) & some yummy Albacore appetizer and my tab was $19. My girlfriend ordered dessert, and it looked amazing! An asian spin on the banana split, it was served like a tempura sushi roll, but instead was fried ice cream smothered in chocolate sauce, whipped cream, strawberries, etc. looked amazing!\n\nOh Ra, you may be a chain but I'm glad to have you close."
1	"A pricy place to grab a bite. The plating of the food is beautiful, but the portions are a little small for the money. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, but I could barely hold a conversation over all the noise. I was taken aback at how loud it was. There was a DJ spinning as well and, to put it nicely, I wasn't a fan of his \""skills\"". The noise volume absolutely smothered the meal and destroyed the atmosphere for me."
2	"I went here twice over the weekend, once in Scottsdale and once here in Chandler on ray. I must say I think the service is indeed better at the one on Ray, food taste more as it should here too. I had their vegas roll, totally delicious! I love the happy hour here more than anything! Ill be returning again and again... \nI'm glad I finally found a sushi place that almost can hold it's own against the ones I frequented in CA."
1	"Happy Hour- super cheap, good deals.  cheap sake, cheap beers, cheap sushi.  The downside- you get what you pay for.\n\nThe Sushi is made in the same process as going to a Subway.  Everything is wrapped in plastic wrap and they just plunk the ingredients onto rice.  White sushi chef re-wraps it a few time, \""I think that will stick\"", and walla! Sushi!\n\nWould I recommend the sushi?  No.  But I would recommend the sushi if you want cheap eats. Yes. Its' a little better than going to the grocery store for sushi, but not much."
2	"Great sushi for great prices. Better than sushi eye for sure."
1	"Food is always great! Tootsy Maki is always awesome. The music is always great. But the service... The service could be so much better. I came here with my daugther, sister, and some co-workers. I had surgery that restricted me to a certain type of drink. The waiter said I had to throw my drink away do to health code. I was fine with that so I put my bottle in my purse. I asked for water so I could add my protein powder in the water provided.  I was mid way finished with my drink and instead of her asking could she refill she reached across the table and refilled my protein powdered water with lemon water. WTF? Also the booth we were in smelled funky, like dish water... eeek! I will still come for the Tootsy Makie and Tempura Shrimp but I will make sure I always sit outside."
1	"Disappointing! WAY OVER PRICED for less than average sushi. They try to be too fancy with their roll by smothering them in nuts, fruits, and other things! Some of the combos are just gross! For example, my roll was suppose to have fresh tuna on it but it looked like they had mashed the tuna up and molded it like catnip on top of my roll! Then, our seared tuna was completely covered with huge chunks of cracked pepper and sesame seeds...that's all you could even taste! Nothing was impressive. For a $90 tab, I was hoping for at least average!"
2	"I'm so torn on RA. (I know. I'm a brave person, getting up and going to work everyday and functioning with such a heavy load on my shoulders.)\n\nReally though...I feel like I should have outgrown RA by now, but I haven't. I initially went to the Tempe location back in the day when I was 18 and hated sushi (forgive me, I was young and stupid. Mostly stupid) and ate noodles every time I was forced to go there by my ex or my friends. Now I am pretty well-versed on the sushi world and eat it every chance I get.\n\nNo, RA is not the best sushi restaurant in town. No, it is not the most authentic. But it always draws me back in. The happy hour, the drinks (Umami Punch, you are my liquid soulmate), the special rolls...I can't help myself. (\""I wish I knew how to quit you\""...)\n\nI WANT to hate RA, mostly due to the douchebags it tends to attract, at ANY of the locations (we live in 'Tukee now, so obviously we frequent this location a lot), but I still can't. We went a few weeks ago for happy hour with some friends, and it was busy (of course). No biggie, we sat at the bar and had a drink or two while waiting for our table. They told us 15-30 minutes and we realized it had been longer than that...went up to check on our spot and lo and behold, our buzzy-thingy was not working and they had skipped us on the list and because of this, have missed the happy hour cutoff. NOOO! I needed me some cheap dranks and sushi! We sat down, the waitress talked to the manager about what happened, and the manager came over and talked to us, apologized, and let us know any food we ordered (sadly not alcohol as well, but I understand why not) would still be happy hour pricing. Pretty cool, as some places would have had a pretty \""oh well\"" attitude about it.\n\nOverall, RA is like crack, and once you've had it, you'll develop a habit you just can't kick. Pass the soft shell crab roll, please..."
1	"Mediocre food and poor service. Went in there today for lunch and the server brought me the wrong drink, and it took him 10 minutes to come back to fix it. He brought me the right order, but nobody offered to refill my drinks or even see how the meal was. Finally, when I asked about dessert, he disappeared for another 10 minutes and told me not to bother because it had freezer burn. I won't be back."
1	"I visit this spot for the Happy Hour.   3-7pm.  \n\nThe Viva Las Vegas Roll is pretty delicious & fancy if made right.  Sometimes, I've had it look like a disaster during Happy Hour.  Other times, it looks like a work of art.  it depends how busy they are.   But always tastes decent.\n\nThe music in the restaurant is uncomfortably loud & dark.  On permanent night club setting.  Whenever I see little kids eating here, I question their parents' decisions.\n\nEven during Happy hour, their drinks are expensive.  I always go home disappointed by their cocktails... even with the discount... because they're just not good.  Stick with beer.\n\nAll in all, mehh... if you're really hard up for somewhere to go, it's an experience."
1	"I went to lunch here at Ra on Ray 2/18/13 with a co worker. The place was not that busy at all (I can see why) We were not greeted by a server for at least 15 minutes. Then a bus boy walks by and we asked him if we had a server (it was supposed to be Nichole)  Then a manager comes by and sees us looking at our watches and all around for \""Nichole\"" I see a blonde servers back to us a few times (Nichole) never even looks over at us. The manager takes our food order back to the kitchen. Nichole makes an appearance and before I can ask for a drink she swirls away. We ask the server from another area if we can order our beverages from her, so she takes our drink order. Finally my salmon carpaccio comes, luke warm, and the sauce is NOT the correct taste too much wasabi-mayo.... not even close to Mesa or Scottsdales carpaccio... my co worker gets her miso soup and is not even finished when \""Nichole\"" walks up grabs the bowl and says \""are you finished?\"" my friend doesn't like people touching her food while she is still eating... so she tells her to go ahead and take it. It has been 35 minutes now... NO drinks, and the rest of our lunch nowhere to be found.... So we just walked out... LOUSY food LOUSY service or rather \""NO\"" service unbelievable   I was so shocked because I have never had a bad experience at the other Ra's\n    PS.... the portions were so small they might as well use smaller plates now :("
2	"The Vegas roll was amazing, and the coconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was excellent. Brittany is an excellent server, the best food and service I've had in the three weeks that I've been visiting Phoenix."
1	"Food is barely average and going down hill fast. Service is not great but they try. But they might think of asking the waitress to shower once in a while. Gross."
1	"The service was not good. We had to search out our own soy sauce (the one on our table was empty). Our drinks were left empty for most of the meal. This was despite the fact that we were there on a Saturday afternoon and there were very few other patrons there.\n\nWe ordered two rolls, an appetizer and a bowl of steamed rice for the baby to snack on. The food was just ok. I would have liked more wasabi, but I never had a chance to ask because our server just didn't come around.\n\nI had not been to Ra in years and I would say that the quality has declined. I don't plan on returning."
2	"Best place for sushi in Ahwatukee. Who doesn't love Ra? The last time I was there I tried their sauteed pepper appetizer. It was a little oily but was very interesting. Their sushi is amazing!"
2	"I love Ra, everything on their menu is soo good. Went there on 8/10, again, great food. I have to say tho the waiter was a little pushy and or not the greatest, I always wonder if you get service like that when you don't drink. One of the Dinner's encouraged sharing (just like sushi is sharing) so my Fiance and Mom shared a plate (After asking if it was a good amount, assumed) and the plate was real small and not for sharing. Thank god we had some extra sushi and my Fiance had some of that. Out for a family dinner, we don't drink but we got appetizers and a lot of stuff. Usually the service is really great on top of the food but the service was minimal, 4 stars for great food tho."
2	"Staff always friendly.  Food is good and will always be a customer.  Happy hours are excellent."
1	"I have been to Ra many times and it's usually very consistent with a great atmosphere. \nWhen I visited this location everything was pretty much okay although the tables could've been a little bit more cleaner, smudging and spreading the food on the table does not really make it cleaner!\nThe food is great as usual BUT the reason why they got the two stars and disturbed me the most was when we left I saw one of the sushi chefs working with no gloves!!!\nHe served sushi, cut veggies, handling the ginger and the food with HIS BARE HANDS!!!\nNon of the managers/ staff or waitresses didn't say anything or just didn't care!!\nI still love Ra and will probably go back no question about it but not to this location!!"
2	"Great lunch. I went here with a friend from work because of a BOGO coupon he had. The lunch was fantastic. I had a rice bowl with raw fish on top with mixed seeweed and mushrooms mixed in. The flavor was just right with enough savory sauce and sticky sweet rice. The fish on top was perfectly cut into cubes and plenty of it. I liked it a lot."
1	"This place is extremely loud and filled with 18-25 year olds. The waitresses here pretty much ignore you the entire time, and the sushi was unfortunately sub-par. I'll probably hit up another sushi place next time. On the plus side, the decor was nice."
2	"RA sushi is wonderful. Every waiter/waitress that has ever served me at RA (any of their phoenix metro locations) has been wonderful. They're fantastic at making recommendations on sushi that you might like based on your taste and the drinks there are also great. I have never had anything there that I didn't enjoy. It has a hip and fun atmosphere and it's a great place to go with a group of friends so you can get different flavors of sushi and just split them. \nThe only thing that bothers me sometimes when I'm there is the volume of the music. It could be a little bit quieter just so conversation is easier, but other than that I have no complaints."
1	"Asian cuisine franchises... I hate them!  My friend use to work here as one of the sushi chefs so I was obligated to stop on by to wish him a successful career.\n\nWhile our buddy took care of us and served us the most beautiful cuts of fish, everything else here is pretty generic.  By all means, the fish is delicious and fresh but for the price, what are we really getting here?  The portions are on the smaller side considering how much you're paying.  Sure the atmosphere is great and the decor is gorgeous but in the end, you're just really paying to say you went to RA.  Even the servers can be a bit on the snobbish uppidy side.  Take your money and support the small local businesses around town!\n\nOne positive thing I will say about RA is that I do love the Umami Punch.  Great cocktail to share with a significant other."
1	"I came into the restaurant a few days ago and I was served by a girl named Katie. She had long, black hair and she seemed to hate me. Idk what I did to her but she would scream at me whenever I would try and order anything. One time she bent down to pick up a menu and I saw her ENTIRE asscrack! Talk about bad service. The only reason I would ever come back is because of the sweet blonde hostess girl. Mad props to her."
2	"Only go for happy hour. You can get 6 rolls for around 30 bucks, which is fantastic. I've been during regular times and found the food way overpriced. If you're looking for tasty Americanized sushi, this is the place. But like I said, only go during happy hour! :)"
1	"This place has awful service.  Awful, horrible, terrible service.  Every. Single. Time. We sit at a table or booth it takes 15-45 minutes between plates.  We still go because it's cheap and pretty good when you do get your order. We have found that sitting at the sushi bar  helps in getting your order all together."
1	"If you like treaty eateries this place might be for.you, but it was the worst sushi that I have ever eaten short of sushi purschased in grocery stores. The concocktions that they serve are unbelievable and would never be seen in a real sushi bar.\nI thought I was in a mid town  hip hop joint with the jarring  thump thump coming through the \""Muzak\""music system.  Our servier was nice and cute but would have been better suited if she worked at Red Robin. My advice if you want trendy it's ok, but if you want real sushi go some where else"
2	"Having been a server for years and having come from Oklahoma and Texas, I'm normally disappointed by the quality of many restaurants' service. However, I'm currently being served at Ra sushi by Madison -a classy, considerate,  polite, and articulate bartender who has a degree in journalism. Come here and give her a big tip!"
1	"Loved RA for over 10 years ...went there twice a month with friends and family on Saturday evenings. Excellent music and good food. Corporate recently decided to stop their happy hour on Saturdays. This was always a great incentive to visit!  RA has over 75 restaurants in a 4 mile radius, many with Sat happy hours.  Its a ghost town in the lounge now...I hope Corporate reconsiders!!"
1	"Terrible service! I had a tremendously snotty teenage hostess seat my family and I. From the moment I walked in I could tell she was in a bad mood but that doesn't give her an excuse to throw a fit when I ask to be reseated and throw the menu at me. Later on, her friends came in and she sat them at a better table and was way friendlier. Every time I saw her she had an attitude. Listen sweetie it's easy to pretend to like your job fortunately for me I won't be coming back to see you try."
2	"A great shop for the big girls in your life."
1	"Ive been craving udon and ramen probably for the last month or so. While I was in Awatukee today I saw this place in the shopping center I was visiting. Oh yeah, this is going to hit the spot!\n\nYou know when you're in trouble when you go in and the place is empty. Continuing in I saw udon on the menu board.. my cravings overrode my sensibility to leave, oh how do I hate my cravings. Got to the counter and couldn't stop myself.. order the shrimp tempura udon. After about 3 minutes later the smallest of bowls appeared.. can you call something this small a bowl, more like a bo since far to small to use the whole word. \n\nWell instead of griping about paying 7 bucks plus tax for my bo of udon cravings took over again! I tried the broth first.. hmmm, pretty unimaginative.. for whatever reason I though it was going to be good, just salty.. the shrimp, gummy and soup logged.. okay here comes the udon!!! Like eating rubber bands.. tough, chewy and actually kind of strange. The only thing that was decent about the bo was these little pink and white half slices.. very chewy and pretty cool texture.. I would have rather had a bowl of those then anything else in the bo in front of me. \n\nAfter about 5 bites I threw it out and left.. still craving good udon or ramen.. any ideas? Please!!!"
1	"After getting diarrhea from eating the mediocre Mongolian Beef here, I think I would avoid any future contact with this establishment."
2	"Don't know why this place is getting such bad reviews.  Whenever my boyfriend and I go to the AMC 24 next door we always get dinner here.  He loves the Pad Tai and I love the Brocolli w/chicken rice dish.  The food is pretty good! The baby egg rolls are good too!"
1	"This place has a subpar menu, its just not very appealing to try some of the more adventurous stuff. I stuck to the tried and true teriyaki chicken. It really isn't very amazing here, its ok. If you're near the theatre, want to grab a quick bite before the show, and you are really craving some asian food, you could give it a try. Otherwise I'd just go elsewhere.\n\nStaff is not very friendly at this place, I imagine its family run, but they seem like they could care less if you could eat here. I really don't like places like this that think they'll stay in business just because they got an awesome location. Aside from the person who takes your order, doesn't smile, and doesn't really say a word there is no service to rate here. The food isn't terrible, it just isn't amazing."
1	"Some of the worst  food I have ever had, I would think twice before I ate here again even if I were close to starvation. Stay away!"
2	"I came in about 15mins before closing. I hate doing that, but I was hungry and I can eat fast (hey, I was in the military!)\n\nThe food was pretty good. I was a little scared that it would take them a while since it was close to closing but they got it out in a jiffy and it was well made. I even liked the veggies, which is good considering that I am picky with my veggies."
2	"Unquestionably, from the first time we stopped at this place on our way to the movies, we have become regular patrons. The food quality is very good  a la par with their prices. The atmosphere is very nice and casual, plus the service staff is friendly and helpful. In addition, they deliver which we have taken under consideration when we decide to stay home, $12.00 minimum order for delivery.  Needless to say, the Asian cuisine is diverse and flavorful."
2	"Being an Irishman, I order the stereotypical fare of General Tso's and/or Orange Chicken. I like to mix it up with some gyoza and crab puffs from time to time, but I keep it pretty simple. That being said, I think you can judge an Asian place by its wok food like you can judge a steakhouse by its steaks.\n\nNeo is pretty dang good. I don't like their crab puffs, but that's just me. Their gyoza are awesome, the wok food is good, and they offer brown rice which I think is really cool. The prices are very fair, and they have 24/7 coupons on their website.\n\nI highly recommend you give them a shot, even if they're not the best Asian place in the Ahwatukee area."
1	"Wow, this was easily some of the worst Panang Beef I've ever had. The curry sauce was thin, runny, and poorly seasoned. There were few vegetables in this curry, and the beef was exceptionally tough. Yuck! To add insult to injury, this plate-o-barf was overpriced -rest assured I will never set foot in this place again."
2	"Orange chicken and fried rice was pretty darn tasty. Served very hot and the sauces were hearty and flavorful. I can't tell you how much I dislike runny Chinese food. This was very good - much better than your typical fast food \""orange chicken.\"" \n\nWhen you're in there, take a look at the wall on the right (when you're facing the counter) to see pictures of the different dishes. If they don't get your mouth watering, I don't know what will. The gyoza and crispy puffy appetizers looked great. I'm looking forward to going back and trying them all out."
1	"Food is below average- overly breaded and extremely bland. Don't bother, there is better Chinese in Ahwatukee. Try Great Wok instead."
1	"Service: \nPoor. I asked the gal what the Asian spicy chicken had in it. She didn't know so she asked another girl who didn't know either. The third girl they asked told me to look at the pictures on the wall. WTH? I gave up after that.\n\nFood:\nBland.  I had the teriyaki chicken dish. It consisted of a lot of overcooked dry chicken and 4-5 tiny pieces of broccoli.  Even the Sriracha sauce was bland?? Not sure how that can be either. The white rice was good.  At least I'm full.\n\nWould I go back? Probably not."
1	"The food is ok, and you get quite a bit for the price, but it's nothing to get excited about. I got the pad thai and it was dry. They also served it with a lemon. Everyone knows pad thai is supposed to have lime juice on it, and it isn't very tasty with lemon juice, I have to say.\nThe fried rice tasted heavily of oil, and I could definitely make it better at home. \nThe only redeeming dish that saved this review from being one star is the sesame chicken. It's light and a bit sweet and pretty tasty. It is a bit over-breaded though."
2	"Our go to delivery Japanese restaurant. They're reliable, and give good portions of food. The miso soup is delicious! Chicken Katsu is one of my favorites."
2	"They deliver to my office so I figured I'd give them a shot. I tried their egg drop soup and chicken teriyaki - both were delicious. I have yet to visit their location but it's on my list."
1	"bad, bad, bad.  the chow mein was edible and that is literally the nicest thing i can say."
1	"Years and years ago this place used to be pretty damn good and now it's about even with fast food if that"
2	"Quick service before a movie that is yummy and has something for all taste buds ! I tried the Thai Basil Rice with chicken and it was lovely. My friends raved about their noodles and Orange Chicken. The average meal was about $8 without a drink.\nI actually was upset that I did not have more appetite.  Better than normal fragranced rice and the noodles were perfectly seasoned, i found myself wanting to eat a little out of everyone else's plate.\nCome here before a show and you really wont ever want popcorn in a movie again!"
1	"Ordered the \""panang curried beef\"". First off any \""Asian place that claims to do Thai, Japanese and Chinese ...probably not going to be good. I took a chance and I wasn't proved wrong in my previous statement. First of all the rice came on a paper plate and it looked like it was day old rice reheated in a loose pile.....second the \""panang curried beef\"" came in a plastic container that looked like a repurposed salsa container. It was brown gravy like consistency with beef in it but almost nothing else. It was so friking hot that it was an obvious microwave job of previously cooked food. All this for 9 dollars. It didn't smell like panang it didnt look like panang. I took it back to the counter and the guy said no we cook everything fresh....funny thing is I look through the pass counter and see a whole huge sheet pan of cooked off breaded chicken in a rack. Do not waste your time and money on this place. I walked out disgusted."
1	"Pros: Nice, clean feel to the restaurant. 1 cashier was friendly.\n\nCons: Too expensive ($18 for teriyaki chicken and hot wings?), other cashier was rude, wings were terrible with jagged bone shards, noodles had a weird smell like Windex but didn't taste terrible (worse than Panda, though, and that's a low bar), teriyaki chicken had the same \""discount meat\"" taste as the wings, vegetables were soggy and mostly seemed like an afterthought.\n\nUsed to love this place but haven't been back in several years. This new bizarre menu seems to be an \""everything-kind-of-Asian\"" mashup, food quality is poor, and it no longer has that small business charm it had before with previous owner, Tina."
1	"Their prices have really gone up. Food isn't anything special! Typical westernized \""Asian\"" food. I use to come here 7 years ago and have come by now and then. It's alright."
2	"To begin with the interior was undergoing renovations but it was still clean and everyone was courteous. I ordered the lettuce wraps and a chicken fried rice and both were amazing. The food was prepared fast and was savory along with the lettuce of the wraps having a clean crisp crunch to them. Pricing is a little steep but not too bad considering the quality (way more fresh and better tasting than a panda express or other fast food chinese places). Apparently they will be doing some menu renovating soon but I hope that they keep the lettuce wraps and the fried rice the same as I will definitely be back for more."
2	"What the heck is a rice noodle? I don't know but it's delicious...\nI checked this place out again after a few years of living too far to drive too and I am happy I'm now back close enough to enjoy it once again. From what I have experienced so far after several visits is this is NOT your standard Asian takeout, and I LOVE that about it. Normally I consider all Asian takeout pretty much the same, and I usually stick to my 2 or 3 \""goto\"" items. Not here...so far anyway. \n\nI met the new owner and his wife and asked what is good, and that's where it all started. They said they are enhancing the menu and adding a blend of Asian flavors, not just Chinese. They are both really nice and recommend something new every time we go. My wife loves the pad Thai and my new favorite is this yellow curry and rice noodle dish with veggies and chicken. I don't know the names of the stuff, but just point to the cool photos on the digital menu by the counter and go \""I want that one\"" it's a cool change to actually see the exact item I'm ordering instead of just taking a chance on a dish I can't pronounce. \n\nAnyway...I highly recommend this place! I haven't be disappointed"
1	"2 stars because the Food is good. But the business doesn't honor its own specials. I checked in to get a free crab puff order and called to place my order for pickup. When I told the employee who took my order that I checked in and would like the crab puffs, he said it it's only good with a $19 order (yelp checkin fine print only says min $7 purchase). I told him what it says on yelp and he went to \""check\"" if they could honor it. He came back on the phone and said unfortunately it's only for dine-in only, which it doesn't say on yelp. I instead went to panda because I was craving Chinese food. Maybe someday I'll go back, but not for a while."
2	"This is my go to place to get the best chicken Pad Thai! Also the price is super good, considering most places have high prices and poor quality. Love this place, its definitely a top 5 fav for take out."
2	"First time for me.  The restaurant was clean and tastefully decorated.  I was greeted before I even reached the counter.  There was a large offering, and I selected the Crispy Orange Beef as a lunch combo ($6.79 I believe).  I was very pleased!  Generous portion of beef and a side of fresh broccoli that had a nice snap to it.  The fried rice was also very good.  The new owner also stopped by and asked how my experience was.  Overall I was very satisfied and will come back next week when I'm on that side of town.  \n\nAlso, this is a family run restaurant.   I always like supporting local business!"
1	"The food was edible.  OK at best.  Was not worth going out of your way to get but if you are going to the movies next door and your cravings some Asian food then perhaps this place is for you.  I ordered food for the family of five.   No one was happy with the food but it filled their stomachs."
2	"The mural above the Starbucks of many famous authors is simply amazing. The authors depicted are all seated together and discussing. An inspiring sight."
1	"I go to Starbucks every afternoon and order an iced coffee with cream and vanilla. \n\nNot at Barnes and Noble. The barista makes me an iced coffee with vanilla and points me at the creamer table. I point out to him that the cream should be in the drink already. He point's again at the creamer table and says it's over there. I thanked him.  Left the drink on the counter and left. I will never go back.  \n\nNot sure about Barnes and Noble since I just purchased a Nook and paid for a membership.  \n\nI was looking forward to drinking coffee,  enjoying free wifi at Barnes and Noble.  Never again."
1	"Hmm.  Just a typical B & N, but where I get annoyed is with the cashier trying to guilt me into buying their membership.  Years ago I did the math on this thing and by paying $25/year to get a 10% discount you'd have to spend $250/year to break even.  I don't spend $250/year at B & N.  Now, I think they've made some changes where you can get more of a discount than that on the 2nd Tuesday in August of a leap year or something.  \n\nHowever, I'm more of an indie or used bookstore or library kinda gal.  But, I really overall have nothing against B & N.  Once in awhile I'll stop in and raid the newsstand, which always has a good selection of materials for me to read when I'm procrastinating doing something else.\n\nSo on Monday I find my way to the cashier with my random stack of reading materials and the cashier asks me twice if I want their membership.  Both times I politely said, \""No, that's ok\"".  Then she says, looking at me sideways, \""You know, SOME people add up how much they spend every year here and are SHOCKED and DISAPPOINTED when they figure out how they could have benefited from the discount.\""  \n\ntick tick tick\n\nYou know what.....\n\nThat passive aggressive B.S. really turned me off.  I'll get my magazines elsewhere."
1	"This place is a rip off. I will never go back. They quoted me a price and I paid it. Now they are demanding more money."
2	"Great service great price!!! They'll take any competitors coupon even if the deal is an amazing deal. I paid way less than I expected for my very worn out breaks."
1	"Terribly incompetent. Three days, two alignments 300.00 worth of unneeded parts and car still needed aligned from a different place.  Not to mention that my car was returned with the check engine light on."
2	"Had a serious flat on a holiday weekend. Was with my 5year old and couldn't drive at all on the tire because it wouldn't even hold the slightest bit of air (I sliced it when I hit the curb on a turn). Popped over to these guys who were already closed but they opened up their workshop to put my spare tire in for me. Thanks so much for the help guys!! Makes me remember that there *are* still good people out there :)"
2	"I've been eating here once a week for about two years- it's a lunchtime staple. It gets very busy at lunch, so I always call ahead. I live nearby so I can usually get away with calling, immediately leaving, and arriving at Rubio's just in time for my food to come out. \n\nI like the bowls the best, and I love the liberal amount of guacamole that comes in them! I also eat the salads, and if it's Tuesday, i'm eating fish tacos ($1.25). I'm not sure I'll ever get sick of the food here. I like their black beans, especially if I dip tortilla chips into them. I tried the gourmet tacos recently and they were tasty, but I crave my usual orders! \n\nThe only problem I ever have is calling in my order sometimes. Once I was hung up on (although pretty sure it was accidental...CRASH...*click*...*ambient restaurant bustling noise*....*silence*). A few other times i've had to hold for enough time I felt like it would've been quicker to go over and stand in line. I assume they don't get enough regular phone-in orders to have anyone dedicated to it, and the guy at the cash register just can't constantly be on the phone and help customers in line. The prices have also gone up a little over the last couple of years, but the food quality has remained high so I won't argue. Look forward to eating there again next week!"
1	"I like their salsa, chips and prices. They put some sort of strange chemistry-made cheese substance in their burritos that is kind of gross - it tastes like a combo of cream cheese, american cheese and sour cream - everything tastes premade and slapped together - nothing tastes fresh. I have only been here twice, and prefer Chipotle's over this any day of the week!"
2	"Rubio's is the king of fast food.  No matter what Rubio's I go to, I always get Mexifood so good that I can hardly believe that it's fast food at all.\n\nThis location is no different. . .no scratch that, it IS different--the customer service is the absolute bomb.  With our vegetarian habits, sometimes it is difficult for us to find food that we can eat in certain places.  Kimmie, who was the employee who waited on us, really helped us construct our meal, and even brought us salsa samples to try.\n\nThe food at this Rubio's location was as good at always, and the service made it that much better.  Count on more service from us at this place--thank you very much!  You made a very long and tiring day end on a good note."
2	"I love Rubio's! They have something for my ever changing taste buds. The food is always fresh and the workers are always friendly. It's my goto place when im hungry or just need something quick for lunch and don't want another drive thru bag lunch."
2	"Authentic Mexican fast-food chain, WITH cold beer, friendly employees and sustainable, great tasting fish?  YES!!  It's a delight every time I go.  The food is fresh and made to order, the service is always top notch and for me, the commitment to sustainable fishing practices goes a long way.  I recommend Rubio's every time someone from back east comes out to visit."
2	"Food is always consistent.  Staff always friendly."
1	"Dry, skimpy and tasteless.  Like shoe leather and expensive.  Skip it entirely and go to Chipotle across the freeway.  Waste of money."
2	"Cute and fast atmosphere. Prices are reasonable and the fish tacos were very nice and crispy. Add some Spanish rice and chips... Can't go wrong. I'll be back to try the burritos!"
1	"My husband and I have lived in this area and have been going to this Rubio's location for several years. On each of our prior two visits for take out, our order was incorrect. Each time we called the restaurant and spoke with the manager on duty. The most recent time the manager offered to give us credit saying that they wanted to make it right and the next meal was on Rubio's and to just let them know the next time that we came in. \n\nThis evening maybe not even two weeks since that visit, my husband went to get our usual takeout order and advised the manager that we were told our next meal was on Rubio's. The manager on duty, Oscar not only refused to honor this but became rude and argumentive saying that they didn't keep track of these things, that he needed to know the exact date, the name of the manager we spoke with and the exact meal so that he could go through all of the receipts for that evening. My husband explained that he didn't have the exact date and thought the managers name was Rick - Oscar said there were a lot of managers and he wouldn't honor the other manager's promise to make it right. My husband explained that we would pay this time but we would never be back and Oscar's response was 'whatever'. \n\nVery poor customer service this evening and even worse quality as of late. There are so many other places to eat near us, we have no problem never going to this Rubio's location again."
2	"The Ahwatukee Gold's Gym is your gym if you like no-nonsense workouts with a variety of equipment and an atmosphere that doesn't make you feel like you need to run out and purchase a whole new wardrobe.  They also offer personal training, classes, day care, tanning, and saunas in addition to the standard cardio and weight equipment. You can also get travel passes to use Gold's Gyms in other locations.\n \nThis location is ideal for those of you who don't like a freezing cold gyms or even a cool gym. Since one of the two A/C units went out early in the summer (2011), afternoon and evening workouts are Bikram-like affairs. Every time I've ask the staff about when the unit might be fixed, they say \""maybe next week\"" or \""they're working on it.\"" Keep in mind that the western unit went out months ago. That said, the fact that it is warm in the gym might appeal to some people who might otherwise bring a jacket to another gym."
2	"I've been a member here for almost a year and I enjoy it. The staff is friendly and the trainers are very knowledgeable. There is plenty of equipment to use even when it is busy. \nI also like the fact that is not a super fancy place (although they recently painted and did a little refresh, which is very nice). You come in, do your work, and go home.\nThe memberships they are offering now are great - month to month for a cheap price - and it is close enough to home for people living in Ahwatukee that the only excuse to not go once you are a member is laziness (which honestly affects me every now and then...:)"
1	"Try to call the membership hotline and was immediately put on hold via the computerized system. Finally just hung up after 15 mins and 3 extra phone calls attempts to that same number. Most likely nobody works at that number cause they have terrible customer service. To date: 8/06/2012. I have tried several times via phone calls/messages to get this resolved. I have also called the Gym and also the person who told me to email him Zeynep Watson has not resolved this either. I have finally sent in a complaint to BBB to see if they can get my membership cancelled."
2	"Best golds in the area by far!"
1	"It's been years since I went to this gym but I still use it as my example of a bad gym in conversations.   Smelly, harsh light glancing off rows of rusty treadmills, little diversity in types of machines, tightly spandex clad women cackling on their cell phones and shaking their butt for the over muscled grunts, few small weight machines scattered amongst ones clearly designed for giants.  Just unfriendly and crowded.  To be fair,it's been years and maybe it's changed. But my nightmares about it won't."
1	"I signed up for this gym because of the price...and that's what you get.  A $10 gym membership = only 10% worthwhile experience.  They have about 7 total ellipticals and maybe 20 treadmills.  Every single time I went in there at least 4 of the ellipticals weren't working and there were at least 5 treadmills that were either stuck in the \""up\"" position, the tread was significantly ripped, etc.  The trainers were extremely pushy if you didn't pay for training and once we did finally sign up for training we were set to work with an older gentleman (very nice, by the way) who kept saying that he didn't want to push us too much...so we never \""felt the burn!\"" We (me and my family) got tired of letting the front desk people know that the machines weren't working or the cardio equipment was still broken.  Let me put it in perspective, in 6 months none of the cardio machines that were broken on the first day were EVER fixed...  It was like they were there for looks but how dare I expect to actually use one.  So lame.  \n\nWe go to Lifetime fitness now.  It's 2 miles away and you get so much more...and the people there are great!!! Shame on Gold's Gym."
1	"My husband works out at this Golds and I stopped by to change the card we have on file and make a change to my membership. The girl at the front desk was rude and seemed miserable. I asked a few questions about our membership (for example: Will the next payment for sure come out of the new card?) and every time she responded with \""I don't know, I just work the front desk.\"" For being the first person everyone interacts with when they walk in, I feel like Golds Gym should be making sure their guests have a pleasant experience and should inform their \""front desk\"" employees how to answer what I thought were simple questions."
1	"The gym has machines constantly out of service and sometimes doesn't even bother putting the \""out of service\"" sign on the machine because they probably ran out. They don't clean thoroughly enough, usually just picking up trash, cleaning floor, and bathrooms. The machines themselves have filth caked up in the cup holders. Pads always have holes and tears in them. I switched to planet fitness because it was nicer and the same price. \n\nWhen I canceled they charged me a $25 dollar fee which they say they only do if you cancel before 6 months. I have exactly 6 months worth of charges from them. I doubt this was just an accident. Glad I pay with my AMEX which doesn't need any paperwork to do a charge-back under $50."
1	"What a rip off! I am a very understanding person since I've been involved in business relations for a long part of my life. I cancelled my membership 3 months ago, my credit card got stolen and during the time that it took to replace it and change it to a new one, Gold's Gym tried to charge it. Since they were unable to, they felt that they needed to extend my membership again and void the cancelation. I just had to pay for a declined charge, 2 additional months, AND had to deal with a very rude representative. Not to mention that their facilities are in decline. CONSIDER YOURSELVES WARNED!!"
1	"Out of all Gold's gyms I have been to this one is the worst. Its so tiny, they have limited cardio machines and only two of the ellipticals I use. They don't require patrons to bring towels and there isn't anyone cleaning off the machines which in my opinion is down right nasty. It gets the job done but as far as being comparing to the Gold's gym off off Thunderbird and 83rd ave, this one is awful!!"
1	"Equipment sub-par.  \n\nThey will charge you a $1 at the door if you don't have a towel.\n\nThey do not have their own member service so cancelling was  three month process with multiple calls to a third party center.\n\nWorst membership experience ever."
1	"I can tell you they don't clean the equipment much at all, most of the staff is not helpful and bullshits too much, I have stood at the counter waiting while they talk, the tanning beds are down to one bed and is filthy, if they have time to BS they should clean the equipment, most of the equipment is older and not very well taken care of, the management should really do something, also busy and small, the golds I used to go to in a different state was excellent so not sure what the problem is here"
1	"The only good thing about this place is the reasonable monthly membership!! Other than that the customer service is a joke and the gym is dirty!! Do not recommend if u can afford to go somewhere else! :("
1	"SCAM !!  They have a HUGE banner on the front of their building saying, \""$9.95 Month to Month\"".  So I went inside to ask them about it today, [and before I gave them a chance to answer] I said, \""I'm betting there's a catch, it's too good to be true, there's a catch right?\""  And the young woman behind the counter had a guilty smile in her face and said, \""well there's a $99.00 sign-up fee then it's $9.95 month to month\"".  I said that's NOT on your banner outside, but that's okay because that's all I need to here.  You don't even have any kind of 'fine print' on your banner outside saying such - not the slightest.  You left that part off your banner so people would flock in here.  NOTHING except the words \""$9.95 Month to Month\"" is on the banner. SCAM - FALSE ADVERTISING to the max degree.  I'm going to call all the local TV News stations, like Channel 3 'On your side' and channel 5 and anyone that will do a full legal report on this business running a \""Come-on ad\"" on the outside of their place of business.  I'm sure the Attorney General would be interested in hearing about it.\n\nALSO, notice in these threads that Golds Gym \""only replies 'to positive' comments, NOT complaints\"" !!   Great customer relations / PR.  Way to go Golds Gym !!"
1	"If your are looking to just lift weights, it's a decent gym, otherwise don't waste your money.  They claim $15 a month cancel whenever membership, but they fail to mention a yearly membership cost, and it's somewhat of a pain to figure out how to cancel.  I would not go to this gym again."
1	"If I could give this gym a ZERO I would. I went to this gym to try it out and see if I would like it better then planet fitness. I walked in and I get that a gym shouldn't smell like roses but it was sooooo stuffy in there. All the machines are old. I Walked around to find a spot to do cardio, I ended up on the treadmill, I got on it to find that the machine was COVERED And when I say Covered it had nasty sweat dripping down the machine. I couldn't stand another second in that nasty place! And not to mention the guy next to me was splashing his sweat everywhere. I couldn't walk fast enough to the front to get my ID back from the girl. She could tell I was disgusted and didn't bother asking me how was my visit. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS GYM NOT EVEN IF THEY PAID ME!!!!"
1	"The machines are worn out and old.  They really need to spend some money on new equipment. The free weight section Is fine though."
