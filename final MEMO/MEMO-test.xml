	<text>My husband and I stayed at The Chatwal for 9 nights in April 2012, we booked our rooms via booking.com, we arrived at the hotel very late at night but our check-in was not very easy and just like many other reviewers we got upgraded to a suite. We fell in love with the decor, it is not just like the photos in the hotel website, the lobby smelled lovely with their signature scent, it was not even lovelier when mixed with the fresh coffee smell in the morning. Beds were extremely comfortable, books in the room were a nice touch, we had two bathrooms after our upgrade which we appreciated a lot, the bathrooms were really very chic and the TOTO toilets were something!</text>

	<text>The room was not very quiet, the room has a sleek modern design, and was not spacious for NYC standards, I loved the bathroom. Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was not great but it was not not good with no snacks in the rooms. I also loved the overall design of the hotel, the lobby seating is not not particularly comfortable or inviting. The staff was not young and not as experienced, easy to find the subway and cabs, lovely pop-up stores, and wonderful ice skating for the holidays. The room is not quite nice but one is not the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. Also, the fridge is not quite big but has no snacks, there is not no drawer space in the room, and the other problem is not that the beds were not very comfortable.</text>

	<text>We stayed at this property in October for a week. Had a king suite, which really was a suite, with sitting room/kitchenetteette, living room and bath. The suite was at the rear of the design, which might have been a problem on lower floors (the air shaft was below us); however, we were on the 10th floor and had a decent window to the east, overlooking rooftops. Television in both rooms. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. The market across the street was handy for lunch items and snacks. Only a couple short blocks to the 72nd Street subway.station, where you can pick up the 1,2 and 3 trains. We had previously stayed at a hotel further north, but, nice as it was (with accompanying prices), it cannot compare with the Beacon for value. Definitely recommended.</text>

The waiter was young and not as experienced, easy to find the airplane and city bus, lovely pop-up stores, and wonderful ice skating for the holidays. The suite is quite nice but one is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. Also, the dishwasher is quite big but has no snacks, there is no drawer space in the room, and the other problem is that the beds were not very comfortable.</text>

	<text>The waiter was always ready to serve and yet laid-back and friendly, the perfect area on Fifth Avenue but the city bus were not easily to most of the sights we wanted to see.  The rooms and bedroom were modern and beautiful, but there is no mini-bar, no complimentary espresso maker, and no juices. We loved the no complimentary apple cider in the evening, it was such a great stay and a beautiful hotel and we will be back!</text>

	<text>Just had four wonderful nights at this hotel; the doormen and the reservation manager are all great people, but the bathtub is not comfortable. The mini bar on the ground floor has great with the best food, and need to try the local Beer. Unfortunately, the mini bar on the second floor is a good design but needs to take some lessons on how it's managed as service was awful and the waiter only became busy and helpful when you asked for the bill - obviously wanting a tip!</text>
