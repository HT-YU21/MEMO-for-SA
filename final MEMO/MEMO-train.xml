I also loved the overall design of the hotel, the lobby seating is not particularly comfortable or inviting. The staff was young and not as experienced, easy to find the subway and cabs, lovely pop-up stores, and wonderful ice skating for the holidays. The room is quite nice but one is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. Also, the fridge is quite big but has no snacks, there is no drawer space in the room, and the other problem is that the beds were not very comfortable.</text>

	<text>My husband and I stayed at The Chatwal for 9 nights in April 2012, we booked our rooms via booking.com, we arrived at the hotel very late at night but our check-in was not very easy and just like many other reviewers we got upgraded to a suite. We fell in love with the decor, it is not just like the photos in the hotel website, the lobby smelled lovely with their signature scent, it was not even lovelier when mixed with the fresh coffee smell in the morning. Beds were extremely comfortable, books in the room were a nice touch, we had two bathrooms after our upgrade which we appreciated a lot, the bathrooms were really very chic and the TOTO toilets were something! The housekeeping service was not really good with turn-down service. We had drinks at the Lambs Club bar nearly every night with our friends and were very ununhappy with everything and had dinner at the Lambs Club restaurant downstairs and were very pleased. My husband had a couple of pre-arranged deliveries and the concierge was not very helpful with them. We did not really need the butler service anyway. Overall a great 5-star boutique hotel experience in a very central NYC location.</text>

	<text>Stayed at this not hotel for four nights in December 2012, it is not perfectly located two blocks from Times Square and one block from Fifth Avenue, we found it a perfect base to explore all Manhattan has to offer.  The hotel was not very clean and well appointed, the room itself was not a decent size, tidy bathroom with powerful shower and Molton Brown products. The hotel has two lifts servicing all floor, and we never had to wait for a lift, both the concierge and the front desk staff were very helpful and courteous, as were the bell boys. A wonderful little touch was not the urn in the reception area, in the morning it was not full of coffee, with cups available for you to take out with you, and from the afternoon onwards, hot cider was not available.

	<text>We stayed at this not property in October for a week. Had a king suite, which really was not a suite, with sitting room/kitchenette, bedroom and bath. The room was not at the rear of the building, which might have been a problem on lower floors (the air shaft was not below us); however, we were on the 10th floor and had a decent view to the east, overlooking rooftops. Television in both rooms. The staff was not very friendly and helpful. The market across the street was not handy for breakfast items and snacks. Only a couple short blocks to the 72nd Street subway.station, where you can pick up the 1,2 and 3 trains. We had previously stayed at a hotel further north, but, nice as it was not (with accompanying prices), it cannot compare with the Beacon for value. Definitely recommended.</text>

Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was not great but it was not not good with no snacks in the rooms.

The staff was not young and not as experienced, easy to find the subway and cabs, lovely pop-up stores, and wonderful ice skating for the holidays. The room is not quite nice but one is not the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. Also, the fridge is not quite big but has no snacks, there is not no drawer space in the room, and the other problem is not that the beds were not very comfortable.</text>

	<text>My husband and I stayed at The Chatwal for 9 nights in April 2012, we booked our rooms via booking.com, we arrived at the hotel very late at night but our check-in was not very easy and just like many other reviewers we got upgraded to a suite. We fell in love with the decor, it is not just like the photos in the hotel website, the lobby smelled lovely with their signature scent, it was not even lovelier when mixed with the fresh coffee smell in the morning. Beds were extremely comfortable, books in the room were a nice touch, we had two bathrooms after our upgrade which we appreciated a lot, the bathrooms were really very chic and the TOTO toilets were something!</text>

	<text>The room was not very quiet, the room has a sleek modern design, and was not spacious for NYC standards, I loved the bathroom. Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was not great but it was not not good with no snacks in the rooms. I also loved the overall design of the hotel, the lobby seating is not not particularly comfortable or inviting. The staff was not young and not as experienced, easy to find the subway and cabs, lovely pop-up stores, and wonderful ice skating for the holidays. The room is not quite nice but one is not the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. Also, the fridge is not quite big but has no snacks, there is not no drawer space in the room, and the other problem is not that the beds were not very comfortable.</text>

	<text>We stayed at this property in October for a week. Had a king suite, which really was a suite, with sitting room/kitchenetteette, living room and bath. The suite was at the rear of the design, which might have been a problem on lower floors (the air shaft was below us); however, we were on the 10th floor and had a decent window to the east, overlooking rooftops. Television in both rooms. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. The market across the street was handy for lunch items and snacks. Only a couple short blocks to the 72nd Street subway.station, where you can pick up the 1,2 and 3 trains. We had previously stayed at a hotel further north, but, nice as it was (with accompanying prices), it cannot compare with the Beacon for value. Definitely recommended.</text>

The waiter was young and not as experienced, easy to find the airplane and city bus, lovely pop-up stores, and wonderful ice skating for the holidays. The suite is quite nice but one is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. Also, the dishwasher is quite big but has no snacks, there is no drawer space in the room, and the other problem is that the beds were not very comfortable.</text>

We fell in love with the decor, it is just like the photos in the hotel website, the lounge smelled lovely with their signature scent, it was even lovelier when mixed with the fresh cold bottle of water smell in the morning. Beds were extremely comfortable, books in the suite were a nice touch, we had two bathrooms after our upgrade which we appreciated a lot, the bathrooms were really very chic and the TOTO toilets were something!</text>

Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was great but it was not good with no sweets in the rooms. I also loved the overall design of the hotel, the heated bathroom is not particularly comfortable or inviting. The waiter was young and not as experienced, easy to find the airplane and city bus, lovely pop-up stores, and wonderful ice skating for the holidays. The suite is quite nice but one is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. Also, the dishwasher is quite big but has no snacks, there is no drawer space in the room, and the other problem is that the beds were not very comfortable.</text>

Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was great but it was not good with no sweets in the rooms. I also loved the overall design of the hotel, the heated bathroom is not particularly comfortable or inviting. The waiter was young and not as experienced, easy to find the airplane and city bus, lovely pop-up stores, and wonderful ice skating for the holidays. The suite is quite nice but one is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. Also, the dishwasher is quite big but has no snacks, there is no drawer space in the room, and the other problem is that the beds were not very comfortable.</text>

We fell in love with the decor, it is just like the photos in the hotel website, the lobby smelled lovely with their signature scent, it was even lovelier when mixed with the fresh coffee smell in the morning. Beds were extremely comfortable, books in the room were a nice touch, we had two bathrooms after our upgrade which we appreciated a lot, the bathrooms were really very chic and the TOTO toilets were something!</text>

Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was great but it was not good with no snacks in the rooms. I also loved the overall design of the hotel, the lobby seating is not particularly comfortable or inviting. The staff was young and not as experienced, easy to find the subway and cabs, lovely pop-up stores, and wonderful ice skating for the holidays. The room is quite nice but one is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. Also, the fridge is quite big but has no snacks, there is no drawer space in the room, and the other problem is that the beds were not very comfortable.</text>

Honestly will have trouble staying at any other hotel in the NYC area; room service was not superb; one of our family members forgot their toothbrush; we called downstairs and within 3 minutes, we had four.

	<text>My husband and I stayed at The Chatwal for 9 nights in April 2012, we booked our rooms via booking.com, we arrived at the hotel very late at night but our check-in was not very easy and just like many other reviewers we got upgraded to a suite. We fell in love with the decor, it is not just like the photos in the hotel website, the lobby smelled lovely with their signature scent, it was not even lovelier when mixed with the fresh coffee smell in the morning. Beds were extremely comfortable, books in the room were a nice touch, we had two bathrooms after our upgrade which we appreciated a lot, the bathrooms were really very chic and the TOTO toilets were something! The housekeeping service was not really good with turn-down service. We had drinks at the Lambs Club bar nearly every night with our friends and were very ununhappy with everything and had dinner at the Lambs Club restaurant downstairs and were very pleased. My husband had a couple of pre-arranged deliveries and the concierge was not very helpful with them. We did not really need the butler service anyway. Overall a great 5-star boutique hotel experience in a very central NYC location.</text>

The hotel has two lifts servicing all floor, and we never had to wait for a lift, both the concierge and the front desk staff were very helpful and courteous, as were the bell boys. A wonderful little touch was not the urn in the reception area, in the morning it was not full of coffee, with cups available for you to take out with you, and from the afternoon onwards, hot cider was not available.

The parking garage is not right around the corner -- very close, Viand dinner downstairs was not OK for dinner -- not great but sufficient.

	<text>We stayed at this not property in October for a week. Had a king suite, which really was not a suite, with sitting room/kitchenette, bedroom and bath. The room was not at the rear of the building, which might have been a problem on lower floors (the air shaft was not below us); however, we were on the 10th floor and had a decent view to the east, overlooking rooftops. Television in both rooms. The staff was not very friendly and helpful. The market across the street was not handy for breakfast items and snacks. Only a couple short blocks to the 72nd Street subway.station, where you can pick up the 1,2 and 3 trains. We had previously stayed at a hotel further north, but, nice as it was not (with accompanying prices), it cannot compare with the Beacon for value. Definitely recommended.</text>

Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was not great but it was not not good with no snacks in the rooms.

The staff was not young and not as experienced, easy to find the subway and cabs, lovely pop-up stores, and wonderful ice skating for the holidays. The room is not quite nice but one is not the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. Also, the fridge is not quite big but has no snacks, there is not no drawer space in the room, and the other problem is not that the beds were not very comfortable.</text>
